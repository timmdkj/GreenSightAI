We \\nhave defined medium and long-term targets and action \\nplans aimed at Net Zero by 2050 (see p.\\u200914 /30-31) .\\nWe are also ambitious in helping our customers reduce their \\nemissions through our multi-energy strategy, which makes \\na wider range of energies available to our customers, \\nincluding low-carbon energies. We track progress through \\nthe decarbonization index of our sales (life cycle carbon \\nintensity of energy producs sold)\\u20091. We have been leading \\namong our peers in terms of actually achieving decarbon -\\nization of the energy products sales mix since 2015. \\nAs part of our contribution to the energy transition of our \\nclients, we are thus developing activities in the production \\nand sales of low-carbon electricity. We also produce and \\nsell liquified natural gas, which is a necessary transition fuel \\nfor building a reliable, low-carbon power system, comple -\\nmenting renewable energies that are intermittent by nature. \\nMoreover, gas helps to decarbonize power generation in \\nmany countries, since burning gas rather than coal to produce electricity emits half as much CO2 for the same \\namount of energy produced (see p.\\u200944-45) .\\nIn this respect, setting objectives to drastically reduce  \\nTotalEnergies\\u2019 global indirect emissions (Scope\\u00a03)\\u20092 in abso -\\nlute value, without an evolution of the overall structure of \\nenergy demand, is in reality not relevant to reduce global \\nGHG emissions.\\n |||  net zero objectives.\\nAn independent third party (Wood Mackenzie)\\u20093 has audited \\nthe calculations made and the trajectories presented.\\u202fGlobal CO2 emissions -  \\nIEA scenarios (WEO 2023\\u20091) \\nIn % vs 2015\\n-\\u200960\\u2009\\n-\\u200960\\u2009-\\u200930\\u2009\\n-\\u200930\\u2009-\\u200940\\u2009\\n-\\u200940\\u2009-\\u200950\\u2009\\n-\\u200950\\u2009-\\u200920\\u2009\\n-\\u200920\\u2009-\\u200910\\u2009\\n-\\u200910\\u2009 10\\u2009\\n0\\u2009\\n0\\u20092015\\n20152020\\n20202025\\n20252030\\n20302035\\n2035  IEA CO2 emissions (E nergy)\\n Scope\\u00a01+2 emissions: TotalEnergies\\n  TotalEnergies - Objectives 2025 (exc.

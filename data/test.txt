# ESG Data Examples

This folder contains a simplified example with only one chunked and indexed PDF,  
to allow quick testing and avoid saturating the GitHub repository.

In practice, when running locally, you can index several dozen PDFs,  
building a comprehensive and efficient FAISS database.

In our project, we worked with around 20 real PDF reports,  
providing rich coverage and improved answer quality.

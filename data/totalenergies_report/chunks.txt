3 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report 3 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report More Energy, Less Emissions Message from Patrick Pouyanné, Chairman and CEO Through this Sustainability & Climate report, I am pleased to present you the concrete progress of our transition strategy, to which we have been resolutely committed since 2020. In 2023, TotalEnergies posted solid results, in line with its objectives while executing its strategy of balanced transition towards an integrated energy company and being the major that invests most in tomorrow’s energy system. TotalEnergies stays the course of its balanced multi-energy strategy... Anchored on two pillars – hydrocarbons, especially LNG on the one hand, and Integrated Power, the energy at the heart of the energy transition, on the other hand, the Company is building a strong position to support the energy transition of its customers. Indeed, thanks to refocusing its Oil & Gas portfolio on assets and projects with low breakeven and low greenhouse gas emissions, and by diversifying into electricity, notably renewable, through an integrated strategy from production to customer, the Company is implementing its transition strategy supporting its customers and stakeholders in their decarbonization while offering an attractive return to shareholders. … responsibly producing low-cost, low-emission hydro- carbons… In 2023, we have reduced our emissions by 24% across all our operated sites compared with 2015, with a 34% reduction for our operated Oil & Gas production, refining and liquefac - tion sites. These results support our objectives for 2030 (40% net reduction). The Scope 1+2 emission intensity of Upstream Oil & Gas activities on equity basis, decreased to 18 kg CO2e/ boe in 2023. Methane emissions from our operated sites, already among the lowest in the sector, have fallen by more than 47% compared with 2020. We are on track to reach our -50% target a year ahead of our 2025 target, aiming for zero methane emissions by 2030 (-80% target). For this reason, we have decided to extend to all our Upstream Oil & Gas operations the target of methane intensity emissions below 0.1% (and not only to Upstream gas operations). We are a leader in LNG, a transitional energy that addresses the intermittent nature of renewable power generation and helps reduce emissions in countries using coal for power generation. As in 2022, the Company evaluated that its LNG sales contributed to avoiding around 70 Mt of CO2e emissions worldwide in 2023.Anchored on two pillars, the Company is building a strong position to support the energy transition of its customers.|page:4

4 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report 4 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report Our growth in power, with a renewable electricity generation portfolio representing more than 80 GW (including 22 GW of gross capacity already installed), positions us as one of the world’s leading solar and wind developers in 2023, and we have the ambition to be among the world’s top 5 by 2030 (excluding China). These developments in electricity contribute to reducing our customers’ emissions generated by the use of the energy we sell them. As a result, the carbon content of the energy sold to our customers fell by 13% in 2023 compared with 2015, and we are well on track to achieving our -25% target in 2030. … in a collaborative approach essential to the success of a just, orderly and equitable transition. TotalEnergies welcomes the agreement reached in Dubai at COP 28, which calls for “transitioning away from fossil fuels in energy systems, in a just, orderly and equitable manner” and which highlights the need for transitional fuels such as gas. As an energy producer and supplier, we need to have the courage to say that the energy transition will mean a higher energy price, because it means building a decarbonized power system using intermittent energy sources, which will have to be supplemented by flexible resources, while investing massively in infrastructure and … and by developing a profitable and differentiated Inte - grated Power business model to create a future cash-flow engine of the Company… TotalEnergies invested $16.8 billion in 2023 of which 35% in low-carbon energies, mainly in power. These massive invest - ments have made it possible to increase our capacities in renewable electricity production (by +6 GW in 2023), storage, flexible production, and distribution (60,000 charging points for electromobility at the end of 2023 including more than 1,000 high-power charging points). The Company is building a world class cost-competitive portfolio combining renewable (solar, onshore wind, offshore wind) and flexible assets (flexible gas power plants, storage) to deliver clean firm power to its customers 24/7. In particular, TotalEnergies is leveraging its purchasing power to optimize its investment costs and industrialize its renewable assets through digital to lower operating costs. In 2023, our net electricity production amounted to 33 TWh, including 19 TWh of renewable power. The Company aims to grow its power generation to more than 100 TWh by 2030, investing on average $4 billion per year; we are aiming for cash flow generation from this segment of more than $4 billion in 2028, with the Integrated Power segment becoming net cash positive by this time.the electrification of uses, particularly in industry and trans - port. In order to make this transition acceptable, we are pursuing the development of new hydrocarbon projects, as the pace of transition will not be the same everywhere in the world. We believe that we cannot ask countries of the Global South to not develop their resources, when OECD countries have been developing them for more than a century to ensure their development. This is also what the Dubai agreement|page:5

of transition will not be the same everywhere in the world. We believe that we cannot ask countries of the Global South to not develop their resources, when OECD countries have been developing them for more than a century to ensure their development. This is also what the Dubai agreement is about. This agreement reinforces TotalEnergies’ transition strategy, which is anchored on two pillars, the responsible production and sales of Oil & Gas, and electricity, notably renewables. TotalEnergies supports the objectives of tripling renewable energies (and aims to do more at its own level) and doubling energy efficiency by 2030, as well as slashing methane emissions within that time frame (“aiming for zero methane”) . TotalEnergies welcomes the agreement reached in Dubai at COP28. This agreement reinforces TotalEnergies’ transition strategy.|page:5

We owe our ambition and our results to our teams, whom I would like to thank for their commitment. As part of its transition strategy aimed at achieving Ambition Net Zero in 2050, together with society, the Company has placed sustainable development at the heart of its strategy, projects and operations. Together, with the Sustainab’ALL program, we are making our collective culture evolve step by step. 2024 is our centenary year. Energy represents the history and the future of TotalEnergies. Rising to the dual challenge of meeting the energy needs of an ever-growing world population while reducing global warming, reinventing energy production and consumption in order to get to Net Zero by 2050, together with society, those tasks underlie the raison d’être of TotalEnergies which is to supply to as many people as possible a more affordable, more available and more sustainable energy.These objectives are an integral part of TotalEnergies’ roadmap for 2030. We share this approach with our stakeholders. We play an active role in disseminating responsible produc - tion objectives in our industry: at COP 28, more than 50 compa - nies from the Oil & Gas sector signed the OGDC (Oil & Gas Decarbonization Charter), committing themselves to reducing emissions from their operations and, in particular aiming for zero methane emissions by 2030. TotalEnergies has actively supported the success of OGDC. And I myself have the honor of having been designated among the 3 “champions” to lead the OGDC with the CEOs of ADNOC and Aramco. When it comes to detection, measurement and reduction of methane emissions, we are sharing our drone detection and measure - ment technology (AUSEA) with several national companies from producing countries: Petrobras (Brazil), Sonangol (Angola), NNPCL (Nigeria), SOCAR (Azerbaïjan), ONGC (India). Every day, TotalEnergies supplies electricity and gas to 8 million homes in Europe, and every day 8 million people visit our 15,000 service stations in 56 countries around the world and 60,000 electric charging points. Our Company works with its industrial customers, particularly those in hard to abate sectors to find solutions to reduce these We are proud of 100 years of pioneering spirit in the service of energy and its challenges. We are resolutely committed to this new path of collective challenges for sustainable development, Net Zero, together with society. We owe our ambition and our results to our teams, whom I would like to thank for their commitment.|page:6

6 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report 6 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report Since the last General Meeting of Shareholders, held in May 2023, I have held the position of Lead Inde - pendent Director, which was entrusted to me by the Board of Directors, and in this capacity I chair the Gover - nance and Ethics Committee. In this context, I oversaw the work that led to the unanimous decision by the Board of Directors to propose to the General Meeting of Shareholders in May 2024 the renewal of Patrick Pouyanné’s term of office as part of the balanced governance implemented since 2015, which led the Board to propose the renewal of my own term of office as Lead Director. In reaffirming its support for the quality and relevance of the transition strategy implemented since 2020, the Board of Directors considered it appropriate to ensure the continuity of the Company’s governance and leadership. Over the past 10 years, Patrick Pouyanné has done an excellent job at steering TotalEnergies in a complex environment, delivering extremely solid financial results and committing the Company to the energy transition more quickly and decisively than its peers. The Board of Directors is unanimously counting on his leadership and strategic vision to pursue TotalEnergies’ transition with determination and consistency, based on 2 pillars: Oil & Gas on the one hand, and Power and Renewables on the other. This vision, which creates value in the medium and long term, and this strategic stability are an asset and a differentiating factor for TotalEnergies compared with its peers. The renewal of Patrick Pouyanné’s responsibilities takes place in the continuing policy of combining functions of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, this management form being considered to be the most appropriate for dealing with the challenges and specificities of the energy sector, which is facing major transformations. Indeed, more than ever, this context requires agility of movement, which the unity of command reinforces, by giving the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer the power to act and increased representation of the Corporation in its strategic negotiations with States and partners of the Company. The unity of the power to manage and represent the Company is also well regulated by the Company’s corporate governance, with a lead independant director who has extensive powers and whom the Board of Directors has judged to be fully fulfilling his role. I also led the evaluation of the Board of Directors’ perfor - mance, which was based on a written questionnaire and individual interviews with each director, as well as on the discussions we had at the annual meeting of directors who do not hold an executive or salaried position (“Executive Session”), which I chaired. The implementation of the tran - sition strategy decided by the Board of Directors makes TotalEnergies the Company most committed to the energy transition among the majors, by developing, in a resolved and structured way, an “Integrated power” business. As a result, TotalEnergies is one of the major players in renewable energies, and the “Integrated Power” business is achieving encouraging levels of|page:7

of Directors makes TotalEnergies the Company most committed to the energy transition among the majors, by developing, in a resolved and structured way, an “Integrated power” business. As a result, TotalEnergies is one of the major players in renewable energies, and the “Integrated Power” business is achieving encouraging levels of profitability. In this context, commu - nication efforts need to be further developed to improve the perception of the fundamental work undertaken by the Company and to ensure that this energy transition is fully recognized by stakeholders. With regard to stakeholders, my role as Lead Director leads me to engage in dialogue with various shareholders, in particular on the Company’s transition strategy, its progress in this area and the updating of its ambition described in this report. For the 4th consecutive year, the Company’s ambition in terms of sustainable development and energy transition will be submitted to shareholders for their opinion. The Annual General Meeting in May 2024 will therefore be asked to give an advisory opinion on this report, which is a concrete demonstration of the shareholder dialogue, open to all stakeholders, that we wish to have, in complete trans - parency, to achieve together a “just, orderly and equitable” energy transition, in line with the Paris Agreement and the Dubaï consensus.

They are often the occasion for thematic presenta - tions. In addition, the climate-related training modules iden - tified among those available to TotalEnergies employees are accessible to Directors. Strategy & CSR Committee At the 2023 Annual Strategy Seminar, the Directors discussed the energy transition in the US and in the world with Dan Yergin, Vice President of S&P Global. The Strategy Seminar also provided an opportunity to examine Integrated Power's profitability drivers, as well as the state of hydrogen technol - ogies and cost assessments. The Audit Committee The Audit Committee, which is already reviewing the extra-fi - nancial performance declaration, has taken steps to take on the new tasks arising from the regulations on the reporting of sustainability information. In particular, it will monitor the process of drawing up the sustainability report that will succeed the extra-financial performance declaration, and which will be published for the first time in 2025 in relation to the 2024 financial year. It also monitors the certification of sustainability information. To define its strategy and take into account the challenges posed by climate change, TotalEnergies relies on a clearly defined organizational structure and governance. Climate and sustainability issues are addressed at the highest level of the organization, by both the Board of Directors and the Executive Committee. Board of Directors TotalEnergies’ Board of Directors is dedicated to promoting long-term value creation by the Company. It defines the Company's strategic orientations and annually reviews oppor - tunities and risks, such as financial, legal, operational, social and environmental risks, and the measures taken in response. It ensures that both the Company’s strategy and the invest - ment projects submitted for its consideration take account of climate and sustainability concerns. To aid the Board in carrying out its duties, a continuous training program on climate was approved for the Directors in 2021.

9 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report 9 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report Our Climate-Related Risks The risks posed by climate change are included among the risks analyzed by the TotalEnergies Risk Management Committee (TRMC). TotalEnergies ranks its risks by type and gravity. In 2022, the TRMC updated its risk mapping and submitted the results to the Board of Directors in early 2023.In the table above, TotalEnergies’ risks are positioned in relation to identified generic risks, in accordance with the recommendation of the Taskforce on Climate-related Finan - cial Disclosure (TCFD). The TRMC also verifies the use of appropriate risk management systems. Additional action plans can be defined when necessary. Audits are conducted to ensure that existing risk reduction and control measures are effective. Personnel from multiple disciplines, segments and businesses may collaborate in carrying out these action plans and audits. The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors monitors the effec - tiveness of the internal control and risk management systems established by senior management, in light of identified risks and with a view to fulfilling TotalEnergies ’ objectives. Adaptation to physical risks We take climate risk into account in the design of our facil - ities and in the evaluation of our sites in operation. Climate change potentially has multiple consequences, including rising sea levels and increased extreme weather events, that can negatively impact our operations. We have issued recommendations for addressing the antic - ipated changes in the climate system and its components in our facility design bases (metocean criteria). Similarly, we evaluate the vulnerability of our sites in oper - ation to weather events so that their consequences do not affect the installations’ integrity or people’s safety. Internal studies have not identified any existing facilities that are vulnerable to the consequences of climate change known to date. 1.

11 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report 11 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report Global Challenges: More Energy, Less Emissions Energy is an essential resource, everywhere indis - pensable for living: for food, lighting, heating and cooling, transport, healthcare, construction and trade. Historically, energy demand has grown in line with demo - graphic growth and rising living standards, as illustrated on the left since 2000. The world’s population is set to grow by almost 2 billion additional inhabitants by 2050. This prospect will have significant implications for achieving the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to improve prosperity and social well-being while protecting the environment and biodiversity. In the countries of the Global South, where access to energy is already one of the limiting factors in human development (see graph below) , populations aspire to improve their quality of life. In OECD countries, energy has enabled socio-economic development that no country is prepared to forego.The IPCC reiterated in 20211 that global warming is the consequence of GHG emissions linked to human activities, and warned of the environmental and socio-economic impacts of this already tangible climate change. “TotalEnergies supports the Paris Agreement.” Since the Paris Agreement in 2015, States have jointly pledged “to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change, in the context of sustainable development and the fight to eradicate poverty, in particular by holding the increase in global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre- industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels”. The energy system must therefore be transformed, because energy is at the heart of this global climate challenge: green - house gas (GHG) emissions linked to the production or use of energy account for over 60% of global emissions in 2021 (ref. IPCC & IEA), as the global energy system is still 80% relying on fossil fuels. There is an urgent need to accelerate the development of a decarbonized energy system, while maintaining the current energy system at a level sufficient to meet global demand and organize a just, orderly and equitable transition of energy systems.

12 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report 12 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report TotalEnergies welcomes the agreement reached in Dubai that calls for “transitioning away from fossil fuels” in a “just, orderly and equitable manner.” Within this framework, TotalEnergies notes with interest the agreement’s reference to transitional fuels such as gas. TotalEnergies supports the objectives of tripling the amount of renewable energy and doubling energy efficiency by 2030, as well as slashing methane emissions within that time frame. These objectives are at the heart of TotalEnergies’ roadmap for 2030. This agreement reinforces TotalEnergies’ transition strategy, which aims, on the one hand, to contribute to the development of a new decarbonized energy system based on electricity and renewables, in which gas plays a useful role as a flexible transitional energy; and, on the other hand, to support a just, orderly and equitable transition away from fossil fuels, notably in emerging countries that legitimately aspire to economic and social development for their populations. Given the energy-related emissions as shown in the chart on the left, reducing the associated emissions implies in the short term: • minimising the share of coal in the electricity mix, starting from OECD countries; • decarbonizing the road transport sector (currently 90% powered by petroleum products); • aiming for the elimination of methane emissions from fossil fuel production processes.To achieve this, massive investments are needed, not only in renewable energy, but also in electricity networks and systems enabling to ensure the availability of the new elec - tricity system. Another challenge is to reduce fossil fuel consumption at the right pace. In the Global South, fossil fuels remain an affordable solution for providing growing populations with access to energy, and therefore greater prosperity. In OECD countries, an accelerated transition means retiring existing assets at country, industry and household levels, and investing in new low-carbon assets. The transition will not take place without social acceptability (both between North and South and within OECD countries) and without genuine efforts in terms of climate justice. Accelerating the pace of investment in low-carbon energies requires strong cooperation between the private and public sectors. • In OECD countries, simplify and speed up the permitting process to accelerate the deployment of grids and renew - able energies. • Actively support the transition of the Global South through (I) the development of multilateral financial guarantees essential to project financing and (II) the deployment of training programs to support the local implementation of new technological solutions.

13 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report 13 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report A Two-pillar Multi-energy Strategy TotalEnergies stays the course of its balanced inte - grated multi-energy strategy… TotalEnergies reaffirms the relevance of its balanced inte - grated multi-energy strategy considering the developments in the oil, gas and electricity markets. Anchored on two pillars, Oil & Gas, notably LNG, and electricity, the energy at the heart of the energy transition, the Company is in a very favorable position to take advantage of energy prices evolu - tion. Thanks to the refocusing of the Oil & Gas portfolio on assets and projects with low breakeven and low greenhouse gas emissions, and to the diversification into electricity, notably renewable, through an integrated strategy from production to customer, the Company is implementing its transition strategy while ensuring an attractive shareholder return policy. …responsibly producing low cost, low emission Oil & Gas. While drastically lowering the emissions from its operations, TotalEnergies plans to grow Oil & Gas production by 2-3% per year over the next five years, predominantly from LNG, thanks to its rich low cost, low emission Upstream portfolio. The Company plans notably to develop a top-tier pipeline of LNG projects (Qatar North Field Expansion, Papua LNG, Energia Costa Azul LNG and Rio Grande in the US, Mozambique LNG) while leveraging its leading position in Europe in regas - ification and its leading LNG exporter position in the United States. TotalEnergies plans to launch the production of its portfolio of high-return oil projects (Brazil, Gulf of Mexico, Iraq, Uganda) recently enriched with exploration successes in Suriname and Namibia. The key indicator of our progress on this pillar is the reduc - tion in Scope 1 + 2 emissions because our first duty as a producer of hydrocarbons is to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions linked to their production. …and developing a profitable and differentiated Integrated Power model to create a future cash engine of the Company. TotalEnergies is replicating its integrated Oil & Gas business model into the electricity value chain to achieve a profitability (ROACE) of ~12% for the Integrated Power segment, equiv - alent to Upstream Oil & Gas ROACE at 60 $/b, above the returns of the traditional Utilities model. The Company is building a world class cost-competitive portfolio combining renewable (solar, onshore wind, offshore wind) and flexible assets (CCGT, storage) to deliver low- carbon electricity available 24/7. In particular, TotalEnergies is leveraging its scale effect in equipment purchase to opti - mise its investment costs and industrialize its renewable assets through digital to lower operating costs. TotalEnergies also uses the strength of its balance sheet to keep market exposure, allowing it to capture additional margins in a market exposure. The Company aims to grow its power generation to more than 100 TWh by 2030, investing around $4 billion per year; the generated cash flow of this segment was $2.2 billion in 2023 and will be more than $4 billion in 2028, becoming net cash-flow positive at that time.

than 100 TWh by 2030, investing around $4 billion per year; the generated cash flow of this segment was $2.2 billion in 2023 and will be more than $4 billion in 2028, becoming net cash-flow positive at that time. Additionally, TotalEnergies invests in low-carbon molecules (biofuels and biogas, as well as hydrogen and its derivatives: e-fuels and SAF). The key indicator of our progress to measure our transition towards low-carbon energy products is the lifecycle carbon intensity 1 of the products used by the Company’s customers. It divides the lifecycle emissions (from production to final use) of our energy products sold (Scope 1+2+3) by the quan - tity of energy supplied (g CO2 e/MJ). The reduction in carbon intensity 1 reflects the lower carbon content of the energy sold to our customers and the Company’s progress in imple - menting its transition strategy. 1.

By 2050, TotalEnergies would produce: • about 50% of its energy in the form of electricity, including the corresponding storage capacity, totaling around 500 TWh/year, on the premise that TotalEnergies would develop about 400 GW of gross renewable capacity; • about 25% of its energy, equivalent to 50 Mt/year of low-carbon energy molecules in the form of biogas, hydrogen, or synthetic liquid fuels from the circular reaction: H2 + CO2 e-fuels; • around 1 Mboe/day of Oil & Gas (about a quarter of the production in 2030, consistent with the decline envisaged by the IEA’s Net Zero scenario), primarily liquefied natural gas (about 0.7 Mboe/d, or 25-30 Mt/year) with very low-cost oil accounting for the rest. Most of that oil would be used in the petrochemicals industry to produce about 10 Mt/ year of polymers, of which two thirds would come from the circular economy. That Oil & Gas would represent: • about 10 Mt CO2e/year of Scope 1 residual emissions, with methane emissions aiming towards zero (below 0.1 Mt CO2e/ year); those emissions would be offset in full by projects using nature-based solutions (natural carbon sinks). • Scope 3 4 emissions totaling about 100 Mt CO2e/year.

16 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report 16 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report How TotalEnergies’ 2030 Objectives Compare to the IEA Scenarios Reducing GHG emissions at our operated facilities (Scope 1+2) is key to our ambition to supply more energy while curbing GHG emissions. Our objective of cutting net Scope 1+2 emissions from our operated activities by 40% is consistent with the reduction targets of the European Union’s “Fit-for-55” program (a 37% decrease between 2015 and 2030) and the IEA’s 2023 Net Zero Emissions (NZE) scenario (a 31% decrease between 2015 and 2030). Our targets for lowering the lifecycle carbon intensity 2 of energy products sold (a 15% reduction by 2025 and a 25% reduction by 2030) put the Company on a trajectory close to the Announced Pledges Scenario (APS) in the IEA’s World Energy Outlook 2023, which assumes that the States parties to the Paris Agreement fulfill all their net zero objectives.

18 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report 18 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report A Strategy to Reduce Our Clients’ Emissions LIFECYCLE CARBON INTENSITY 1 OF ENERGY PRODUCTS SOLD By 2030, we intend to reduce the emissions linked to the energy we supply to our customers by 25% compared to 2015. In other words, we intend to decrease by 25% the carbon intensity 1 of energy products sold, which accounts for the lifecycle emissions (Scope 1+2+3) of our energy products per unit of energy sold (g CO2e/MJ). Indeed, by offering our clients an increasingly decarbonized portfolio, we contribute to the energy transition and help our clients reduce their emissions. In 2023 we maintained our progress thanks to sales growth of renewable energy by notching a 13% reduction in the lifecycle carbon intensity 1 of our products compared to 2015. Growth in electricity will drive more than half the reduction in our lifecycle carbon intensity 1 between 2015 and 2030. The other factors will be the reduction in sales of petroleum products coupled with an increase in gas production (partic - ularly LNG) and sales of products derived from biomass. Lastly, lower emissions from our facilities will contribute to 10% of the intensity 1 reduction.

20 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report 20 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report Texas is the 2nd largest state in the United States in terms of surface area and population (~30 million), and the 2nd largest in terms of electricity consumption (nearly 445 TWh in 2023). TotalEnergies set up operations there in 1957 and has built up a strong position with nearly 2,000 employees. The Company deploys there its strategy based on 2 key pillars: Oil & Gas, mainly LNG, and Integrated Power. Focus on gas - Upstream LNG integration After our historical roots with the Port-Arthur refining and petrochemicals platform and our Upstream assets in Barnett, TotalEnergies is expanding in the LNG segment through the Rio Grande LNG liquefaction terminal project in South Texas, which has all the necessary permits and for which the investment decision for the 1st phase (17.5 Mtpa) was made in July 2023. Start-up is scheduled for 2027. TotalEnergies shall offtake 5.4 Mtpa of LNG for 20 years, which brings the Company’s US LNG export capacity to more than 15 Mtpa by 2030.

It is mainly managed by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), which oversees the electrical grid. With such a congested network, prices are set at its 4,500 nodes. Liquidity and volatility are among the highest in the country, with spark spread levels particularly high in summer (in contrast to our European electricity portfolio, which is more stressed in winter). This market offers numerous opportunities for renew - able energy and flexible production. TotalEnergies has built up a 4 GW portfolio of renewable assets in this market, supplemented with gas-fired power plants. Indeed TotalEn - ergies acquired the US company TexGen holdings three gas-fired power units representing 1.5 GW of electricity generation capacity in Texas.

21 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report 21 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report Disciplined and Sustainable Investments to Support our Strategy INVESTMENT STRATEGYWe are maintaining an annual capital expenditure target of $14-18 billion over the next 5 years. Spending on low-carbon energy will represent 1/3 of our investments, more than new Oil & Gas projects (~30%). TotalEnergies invested $16.8 billion in 2023, including 35% for low-carbon energy mainly in power. In 2024, we plan to invest between $17 and $18 billion, including a further $5 billion for Integrated Power. Consistent with our commitment to build a multi-energy Company, we have begun publishing financial indicators for the Integrated Power segment from April 2023. Continuing to invest with discipline In a global economic context marked by inflation, it is essen - tial to maintain our investment criteria to ensure the profit - ability and resilience of our portfolio. Each material invest - ment project is assessed taking into consideration the aims of the Paris Agreement on the basis of the following criteria: • project profitability is analyzed in a hydrocarbon price scenario compatible with the Paris Agreement objectives of limiting temperature rise to “well below 2°C” and with a carbon price of $100 per ton (or the prevailing price if higher in a given country);• for new Oil & Gas projects (greenfield projects and acqui - sitions), the intensity of Scope 1+2 greenhouse gas emis - sions is compared, depending on their nature, to the inten - sity of the average greenhouse gas emissions of Upstream production assets or that of various Downstream units (LNG plants, refineries) of the Company; • as of 2024, the threshold has been lowered to 18 kg CO2e/boe, versus 19 kg CO2e/boe previously – evidence of the effec - tiveness of our criteria. For additional investments in existing assets (brownfield projects), the investment will have to lower the Scope 1+2 emissions intensity of the asset in question. The goal is for each new investment to contribute to lowering the average intensity of the Compa - ny’s Scope 1+2 greenhouse gas emissions in its category. • For projects involving other energy and technologies (biofuels, biogas…), GHG emission reductions are assessed based on the amount by which they will reduce the carbon content of our sales.

23 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report 23 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report A Resilient Portfolio MERIT CURVE OF GLOBAL OIL PRODUCTION COST 1 Technical cost, $/b TotalEnergies has strengthened the resilience of its portfolio through very active portfolio management in recent years: the Upstream portfolio has seen a 50% portfolio change since 2015, ensuring an oil reserves replacement ratio above 100% over 2015-2023. Our portfolio has a low breakeven point, in line with the Company’s objective of keeping it below $30/b (the Company’s organic cash breakeven point before dividends is $22.2/b in 2023), which ensures the competitiveness of its resources. For its Upstream Oil & Gas activities in 2023, TotalEnergies has the lowest production cost per barrel of around $5.5/boe among its peers 2 and its GHG emissions intensity (Scope 1+2) is falling to 18 kg CO2e/boe in 2023 (compared with 19 in 2022) 3. The average life of the Company’s proved and probable Oil & Gas reserves is 18 years, and the discounted value of its Upstream Oil & Gas assets over 20 years old represents less than 15% of their total value. Risks of stranded assets In June 2020, TotalEnergies determined that among its Upstream assets, only the Fort Hills and Surmont oil sands projects in Canada could be classified as stranded assets, meaning assets with reserves beyond 20 years and high production costs, whose overall reserves might therefore not be produced by 2050. TotalEnergies has sold these assets in 2023. This portfolio management approach allows TotalEnergies to mitigate the risk of stranded assets in the future if the risks of a structural decline in demand for 1.

24 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report 24 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report • Assuming a CO2 price of $200/ton from 2024 and an annual increase of 2% beyond 2029, i.e. an increase of $100/ton compared to the base case scenario from that date onwards, TotalEnergies estimates a negative impact of around 15% on the discounted present value of all its assets (Upstream and Downstream). • Compared with the reference scenario used to evaluate investments (Brent at $50/b), the use of the IEA’s 3 NZE price scenario would lead to a present value of all the Company’s assets (Upstream and Downstream) that is around 10% lower. Impairment of Upstream assets In addition, to ensure robust accounting of its assets in the balance sheet, the Company calculates the impairment of its Upstream assets on the basis of an oil price trajectory that stabilises until 2030, then decreases linearly to reach 50 $2023/b in 2040, and then decreases from 2040 onwards to the price adopted in 2050 by the IEA’s NZE scenario, i.e. 25.5 $2023/b. Gas prices in Europe and Asia decline and stabilise from 2027 until 2040 at levels lower than current prices, with the Henry Hub remaining at $3 $2023/MMBtu over this period. They then all converge towards the prices in the IEA’s NZE scenario in 2050. 3.World Energy Outlook 2023, Table 2.2 Fossil fuel prices by scenario (p. 96). 4.

In 2023, these non-conventional hydrocarbons accounted for 9.7% of our production and less than 5% of our consolidated turnover. In addition, TotalEnergies no longer produces oil from tar sands since the divestment of its Surmont and Fort Hills Canadian assets at the end of 2023. The Company also exited its extra-heavy oil development projects in Venezuela’s Orinoco Belt in 2021. Ultra-deep offshore, defined as water depths in excess of 1,500 m, which in the 2000s represented the technical limit for drilling and production facilities (since then largely exceeded), does not fall into the category of non-conventional hydrocarbons: in fact, reservoirs located in these areas are developed using facilities that employ a continuum of conventional technologies. It is the combination of very high-pressure reservoirs and very deep-water depths that can present increased risks. TotalEnergies does not intend to develop this type of asset.

non-conventional hydrocarbons: in fact, reservoirs located in these areas are developed using facilities that employ a continuum of conventional technologies. It is the combination of very high-pressure reservoirs and very deep-water depths that can present increased risks. TotalEnergies does not intend to develop this type of asset. Similarly, the mere fact that an oil or a gas field is located in an Arctic zone is not sufficient to qualify it as unconventional, if it is operated using conventional technologies. However, the Company recognizes the particular environmental sensitivity of certain Arctic zones. For this reason, in 2012 we undertook not to explore any oil fields in Arctic sea ice; a list of our licenses in Arctic zones is available on the Company’s website.|page:25

29 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report 29 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report Producing Oil Differently: Focus on Low-cost and Low-emission Oil Assets In addition, it will evolve in a differentiated way according to the specific energy transition roadmaps of the various countries. Thus, demand for oil could start to decline around 2030, but at a slower rate than the current natural decline rate of existing fields (around 4% per year). TotalEnergies therefore believes that new oil projects are still needed to meet this demand and to keep prices at an acceptable level in order to create the conditions for a just transition that allows people time to adapt their energy use. In 2023, TotalEnergies produced 1.4 Mb/d of oil, equivalent to its 2019 level, representing around 1.5% of world produc - tion. The first responsibility of TotalEnergies as an oil producer is to produce differently, meaning while minimizing emissions. To that end, we approve hydrocarbon projects on the basis of performance criteria, notably technical costs and carbon intensity (Scope 1+2) - (see p. 21-22) . We operate our fields in accordance with strict requirements concerning safety, emissions reduction and environmental impact. The cash flow generated by these Oil & Gas activities contributes to accelerating our investments in renewable energy. In 2023, global demand for petroleum products reached 101.8 Mb/d, i.e. + 2.3 Mb/d compared to 2022, and should continue to grow over the decade according to the IEA (105.7 Mb/d by 2028). These demand forecasts remain dependent in particular on population and economic growth, market penetration pace of low-carbon technology innovations such as electric vehicles and changes in behavior.En Mb/dGLOBAL OIL DEMAND 1 90 80 100 70 2028 2027 2026 2025 2024 2023 2022 2021 2020 2019+2+1 1.

A first floating production storage and offloading vessel (FPSO) started up in May 2022, followed by a second at the end of December 2023. These will be followed by two more staggered until 2025. We are also present in the offshore Atapu and Sepia fields, corresponding to low-cost, low-emission reserves, where a decision on the production start-up of two new FPSO is currently being studied. • In Iraq, the GGIP (Gas Growth Integrated Project) is a major multi-energy project (see Focus on Iraq) . • TotalEnergies is focusing its exploration investments on oil prospects with low technical costs, low GHG emissions and short lead times. In particular, in 2023 we continued to evaluate and assess the discoveries made in Suriname in 2020, enabling the launch of development studies for a major 200 kb/d oil project on Block 58, offshore Suriname. In 2023, TotalEnergies also continued to evaluate and appraise the discovery made in Namibia in 2022. • In Canada, TotalEnergies sold its oil sands interests in November 2023 in order to focus its capital allocation on assets with a low breakeven point and low-carbon intensity.HIGHLIGHTS|page:30

30 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report 30 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report Relentlessly Reducing Our Scope 1+2 Emissions, Oil & Gas Our primary responsibility as a producer of fossil fuels is to substantially reduce emissions on our facilities. We are resolutely continuing to reduce emissions from our operated sites . Across the 2015 scope of our Oil & Gas activities, emissions from our operated assets fell by more than 34% from 2015 levels, dropping from 46 to 30 Mt CO2e in 2023 (a decrease by 36% for Oil & Gas operated upstream and a decrease by 32% in Refining & Chemical). In 2023 , with more than 140 GHG emissions reduction proj - ects coming to fruition, we reduced our emissions by 1.5 million tons of CO2e across our operated assets. These ongoing reduction efforts have made it possible to reduce the Scope 1+2 equity intensity of our Upstream Oil & Gas assets, from 20 kg CO2e/boe in 2020 to 18 kg CO2e/ boe in 2023 1. These results put us among the players with the best intensities in the industry. Mt CO2eSCOPE 1+2 FROM OPERATED OIL & GAS FACILITIES SCOPE 1+2 UPSTREAM INTENSITY, EQUITY BASIS-34% vs 2015 1.

Since 2000, TotalEnergies has made a commitment to no longer use it for its new projects. As founding member of the World Bank’s “Zero Routine Flaring by 2030” initiative since 2014, the Company is committed to ending this type of flaring by 2030. In Nigeria, the OML100 asset was representing in 2020 57% of E&P global routine flaring. The end of routine flaring on the OML100 offshore block became effective in 2023 following the implementation of a vast project which was realized during planned turnaround. This was the last TotalEnergies asset in Nigeria with routine flaring by design (original design, facilities commissioned in 1993). Significant modifications to the installation were carried out in order to send the gas produced to the Bonny LNG plant instead of being flared (excess gas exported to NLNG plant and valorized). CO2 reduction is around 330 kt CO2e/y.HIGHLIGHTS|page:31

31 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report 31 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report Scope 1+2 Emissions Reduction by 2030 Scope 1+2 emissions reduction objectives TotalEnergies reaffirms its decarbonization objective, which aims to reduce its Scope 1+2 net emissions by -40% to 2030 compared to 2015, net of 5-10 Mt of natural carbon sinks. Our objectives include emissions generated by the growth strategy in electricity we have pursued since 2015, which has prompted us to create a flexible power generation port - folio of plants (CCGT). In 2023, GHG emissions from our operated assets were 24% lower than in 2015, standing at close to 35 million tons of CO2e. Between 2022 and 2023, the reduction in these emissions is 13%. It is mainly due to lower utilization rate of CCGTs, emissions reduction projects, such as for example the reduction of burning in Angola and Nigeria, and the improve - ment of energy efficiency (see next page) . To achieve our 2030 target, we are mobilizing every tool at our disposal to avoid and reduce emissions from our oper - ations. Compensation from natural carbon sinks will only begin from 2030 onwards, to offset residual emissions in pursuit of our objective, on the basis of a consumption of about 10% of our stock of carbon credit units per year.

In September 2022, TotalEnergies launched a plan to accel - erate energy efficiency gains at its operated sites worldwide. We are investing $1 billion in efforts to further reduce our energy use. This plan, centered on four key levers, will support the measures adopted over the past several years within the Company’s business segments. Each business segment has developed a plan to accelerate its energy savings, with more than 150 initiatives logged at Exploration & Production, over 200 projects at Refining & Chemicals and more than 40 initiatives at Marketing & Services and Gas, Renewables & Power. To keep up with these efforts, a growing number of sites are ISO 50001 certified. The projects already identified which will be launched in 2024 should make it possible to achieve the reduction objective of 2 Mt CO2e. ENHANCING ENERGY EFFICIENCY AT OUR OPERATED FACILITIES ELECTRICITY AND RENEWABLES • In Argentina, preparation for the connection of the Neuquén E&P 1 installations to the electricity network. • In Nigeria, launch of the solarization project on OML58 (Upstream asset). • In the Marketing & Services segment, pursuing and accelerating the solarization of our service station networks which can be combined with storage capacities (batteries).

There are multiple levers used to reduce emissions: continuous improvement in energy efficiency, replacement of consumed hydrogen by green hydrogen, electrification of rotating machines, replacement of liquid fuels by natural gas and use of green electricity. Here are some concrete examples of current projects: Improving energy efficiency thanks to our 2-years plan More than 200 projects (associated with a 400 M$ budget), have been implemented to reduce the segment’s energy consumption by 5% (reduction of flaring thanks to state of the art equipment’s, digital energy management system, improved thermal integration, optimization of processes such as exchanger fouling management, and assets design improvement such as Normandy reformer design). Decarbonizing hydrogen in our European assets The ambition of Refining & Chemicals segment is to substi - tute by 2030 the 500 kt/y hydrogen used in European refin - eries by green H2, in the framework of EU RFNBO regulation. This ambition started with a partnership which aims for the construction and management of an electrolyzer by Air Liquide (see diagram) , and the supply by TotalEnergies of around 700 GWh/year of renewable electricity to power it. This action of decarbonizing hydrogen in our European assets would enable in 2030 up to 5 Mt CO2/y avoided emissions.Electrification Progress is made in the electrification of rotating machines (30 MW, GHG emissions reduction of 100 kt CO2e/year), heat tracing of pipelines, and feed preheaters. Shift to Green Power supply The ambition is to have our operated facilities in Europe and the United States benefitting from the supply of 100% green electricity from 2025 (US and Europe Refining Scope 2 power ca. 2.5 Mt CO2). It will be enabled by our Go Green initiative aiming to cover all industrial sites’ power needs with green electricity in Europe and the US (~6.5 TWh/y). Hence in Europe, ~ 5 TWh/y will be supplied to R&C assets from Euro - pean renewable portfolio whereas in the US, ~ 1.5 TWh/y will be supplied to R&C assets from renewable portfolio in Texas. This action of shifting to green power supply would enable in 2025 a 2.5 MtCO2/y emission reduction (~100% of Scope 2 power) representing a 10% emission reduction vs 2015 RC Scope 1+2.

35 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report 35 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report In the gas markets, TotalEnergies focuses on Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG), which can be shipped everywhere in the world and thus contributes to energy security, as it has been the case in Europe since 2022 with the strong reduction of Russian pipeline gas deliveries. The growth of renewable electricity, intermittent and seasonal by nature, will require an increase in flexible power generation resources. The flexible production of gas- fired power plants, which emit half as much greenhouse gas as coal-fired power plants for the same amount of elec - tricity produced 1, enables to secure electricity generation which does not depend on weather conditions contrary to renewable energy, and to face demand fluctuations. In addition, natural gas plays an essential role in reducing emissions from power generation as a replacement of coal, particularly in Asia where this one still acounts for a very large part of the electricity mix of many countries (e.g. 63% in China, 72% in India) 2. With diversified positions, and in particular its leading posi - tion of exporter in the United States - over 10 Mt in 2023 - TotalEnergies is the 3rd world’s largest LNG player, with 44 Mt sold in 2023. The Company intends to consolidate its posi - tion as an integrated player by developing a first-class port - folio that will enable it to achieve 50% growth in volumes between 2023 and 2030.

In addition to its efforts to reduce methane emissions (see following pages) , initiatives are being implemented throughout the whole chain. The electrification of liquefac - tion plant processes is helping to reduce LNG’s carbon footprint today, and tomorrow this reduction will be rein - forced by CO2 capture and storage projects. We are also working to reduce shipping emissions by renewing our fleet of chartered LNG carriers with modern, high-performance vessels.|page:36

36 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report 36 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report down 47% vs 2020. TotalEnergies now aims to reach its 2025 target of -50%, one year ahead of schedule, in 2024. TotalEnergies is a signatory of the Oil & Gas Decarbonization Charter launched at COP28 (see next page) , which includes the ambition “Aiming for near-zero Upstream methane emissions by 2030” . In line with this collective ambition, TotalEnergies is strengthening its methane intensity 5 target of less than 0.1% by 2030 on its gas facilities, by extending it to all its operated Upstream Oil & Gas facilities. At the same time, TotalEnergies is fully assuming its leader - ship role in the fight to collectively reduce methane emissions.Methane is a greenhouse gas with a global warming potential 30 times higher than that of CO2 and a much shorter atmospheric lifetime 2. This makes reducing methane emissions a priority in efforts to mitigate global warming. To date, more than 150 countries have signed the Global Methane Pledge launched in Glasgow in 2021, which aims to reduce methane emissions by 30% from 2020 levels by 2030. Anthropogenic methane emissions come mostly from energy, waste and agriculture. Around 25% 3 come from the Oil & Gas industry . T otalEnergies believes that it is the industry’s responsibility to aim for zero methane emissions by 2030 and wants to set an example for the industry. Our plan is based on three actions: elimi - nating routine flaring, eliminating vents and repairing leaks as soon as they are detected. Continuous excellence in our operations TotalEnergies has already reduced its operated methane emissions by more than 60% since 2015, date of the Paris Agreement, even though the Oil & Gas industry as a whole has maintained an almost constant level of emissions over this period, according to IEA estimates. In early 2022, we set very ambitious, specific targets for the decade ahead that call for a 50% reduction from 2020 levels by 2025 and 80% by 2030 4. These targets cover all of the Company’s operated assets and go beyond the 75% reduction in methane emissions from Oil & Gas by 2030 (vs 2020) as recommended by the IEA when creating the NZE scenario. TotalEnergies is making rapid progress towards this objec - tive: in 2023, our operated methane emissions were 34 kt, METHANE EMISSIONS ON OPERATED FACILITIES 2.

OGMP 2.0 Gold standard In its “An Eye on Methane” report for 2023, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) 7 confirmed TotalEnergies’ Gold Standard status for the 3rd year in a row, and rated our strategy for engaging partners in our non-operated assets as “all-stars” 8. Each year, this report reviews the deployment by Oil & Gas companies of the Oil & Gas Methane Partnership’s OGMP 2.0 framework, which was created in 2020 to guide reporting on methane in the Oil & Gas industry. The framework encourages companies to continue improving their reporting of operated and non-operated emissions and focuses on performing on-site measurements to verify that estimates are exhaustive and accurate. Support for the World Bank’s new methane trust fund TotalEnergies was the first Company to announce a contribution of $25 million over the period 2024-2030 to the Global Flaring and Methane Reduction (GFMR) trust fund launched by the World Bank at COP28. The GFMR will target, finance and support strategic projects to eliminate routine flaring and reduce methane emissions in countries with the greatest emissions reduction potential.HIGHLIGHTS|page:38

This capacity is more than 100 times greater than the 45 Mt CO2 per year currently captured worldwide. Our CCS strategy gives priority to decarbonizing our activities in order to reduce Scope 1+2 emissions from our Upstream Oil & Gas assets, refining and LNG plants. For example, at the Snøhvit liquefaction plant, where we are a partner along - side Equinor, around 8 Mt of native CO2 have been stor ed since 2008. Similarly, the native CO2 separated in the new NFE and NFS LNG liquefaction trains currently under devel - opment will be stored by QatarEnergy. The same will be true for the native CO2 separated on Cameron LNG to be stored in the Hackberry CCS storage facility in the context of a new train project by Cameron LNG. Finally, for our Ichthys LNG asset in Australia, we are studying a native CO2 storage solution for start-up before 2030. The study of CCS solutions on our assets therefore complements the efforts already mentioned to reduce emissions (elec - trification, energy efficiency, flaring reduction, etc.). The Company also invests in CO2 storage projects for third parties (“Storage as a Service”), offering CO2 storage solu - tions to large industrial customers who can thus reduce their Scope 1 emissions and secure the future of their activ - ities. By 2023, we have already invested around $100 million in this business. We will continue to invest heavily in storage projects, both for our own assets and for third parties, to achieve our objective of developing more than 10 Mt CO2 3 of storage capacity by 2030. Europe is at the heart of this CCS strategy. Our Company is one of the incumbent operators in the North Sea and has recognized operational and geological expertise in the area. The United Kingdom, Norway and Europe have set themselves objectives, regulations and provided significant financial support to promote the cross-border deployment of CCUS 4. We are currently developing five projects in the North Sea that will provide decarbonization solutions for our assets and those of our customers. Our ambition is to continue to acquire new exploration permits to increase our CO2 storage capacity after 2030. We are also investigating the use of carbon in various forms (CCU 5). 1.

39 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report 39 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report Offsetting Residual Emissions with Natural Carbon Sinks fied by the Australian Carbon Credit Units Scheme of the Australian Government). We have allocated $100 million annually for these projects, and the cumulative budget pledged for all of these campaigns amounts to nearly $725 million over their cumulated lifespan, with the accu - mulated credits expected to total 44 million in 2030 and 71 million in 2050. The final tally of credits obtained will be determined once the projects have been completed. If such a stock of 44 million credits is built up in 2030 and on the basis of a consumption of 10% of the stock per year from 2030, then TotalEnergies would use around 5 million credits per year from 2030 onwards. Natural areas preservation and restoration can be a lever for achieving net zero emissions worldwide by 2050. Only in 2030 will TotalEnergies begin voluntary offsetting its residual emissions via NBS (Nature Based Solutions) carbon credits and will offset only Company’s Scope 1+2 residual emissions. We are working to build a high-quality portfolio and are paying close attention to the integrity and permanence of the emissions reductions and sequestration achieved by the activities financed in this way. We are in favor of strength - ening a global framework of trust to further reinforce robust and recognized voluntary crediting mechanisms. We are investing in forestry, regenerative agriculture and wetlands protection projects. Our strategy aims to combine and balance the value of people’s financial revenue from agriculture and forestry and the value of the benefits to soil, biodiversity, the water cycle and the production of carbon credits. When that approach is successful, the local standard of living improves and degradation of the land diminishes – as do emissions. This search for balance among different practices makes a just transition possible.

40 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report 40 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report Actively working With Our Partners on Non-Operated Assets Our Scope 1+2 emissions based on equity share amounted to 49 Mt CO2e in 2023. Half of those emissions are attributable to our interests in sites we operate; the remaining being from our interests in sites operated by our partners. We are actively mobilizing our partners to reduce emissions from assets they operate. At Exploration & Production, a dedicated team is tasked with sharing best practices with our partners at non-operated assets, such as deploying a decarbonization roadmap that includes an energy assessment, reduction of methane venting and routine flaring, and improving energy efficiency, particularly for gas turbines and compressors. We use the projects conducted at our operated sites to illustrate ways our partners can reduce their Scope 1+2 emissions and encourage uptake. Upstream emissions can also be reduced by reinjecting the CO2 extracted with the gas produced. This reinjected volume currently represents almost 2 Mt per year in Company’s equity share, particularly in Brazil, and is set to grow signifi - cantly as associated gas production increases.

Moreover TotalEnergies’ venting free oil tank design has been incorporated on Sepia 2 and Atapu 2 and FID has been taken in 2024 for an innovative subsea technology called HiSep® to reinject CO2 rich gas into the Mero field. COP28: signing of the Oil & Gas Decarbonization Charter At COP28, a major initiative between national and international oil companies was launched to reduce the industry’s GHG emissions: the Oil & Gas Decarbonization Charter (OGDC). This initiative brings together more than 50 companies, two-thirds of which we are partner with, representing over 40% of the world’s oil production. This is an historic step forward, as it brings together for the first time international oil companies (IOCs) & national oil companies (NOCs) from this sector around concrete objectives not only to act on their emissions (net-zero operations by 2050 or earlier, elimination of routine flaring by 2030 and aiming for near zero Upstream methane by 2030) but also to report on their actions. TotalEnergies was one of the first companies to sign the Charter, and its CEO Patrick Pouyanné was chosen to represent the IOCs on the OGDC’s three-person co-chairmanship, formed by the CEOs of ADNOC, Aramco and TotalEnergies.HIGHLIGHTS|page:41

41 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report 41 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report FOCUS WHAT ARE THE RELEVANT INDICATORS FOR REDUCING GHG EMISSIONS WORLDWIDE? We are ambitious in our targets for direct emissions (Scope 1+2), which we control in our operated facilities. We have defined medium and long-term targets and action plans aimed at Net Zero by 2050 (see p. 14 /30-31) . We are also ambitious in helping our customers reduce their emissions through our multi-energy strategy, which makes a wider range of energies available to our customers, including low-carbon energies. We track progress through the decarbonization index of our sales (life cycle carbon intensity of energy producs sold) 1. We have been leading among our peers in terms of actually achieving decarbon - ization of the energy products sales mix since 2015. As part of our contribution to the energy transition of our clients, we are thus developing activities in the production and sales of low-carbon electricity. We also produce and sell liquified natural gas, which is a necessary transition fuel for building a reliable, low-carbon power system, comple - menting renewable energies that are intermittent by nature. Moreover, gas helps to decarbonize power generation in many countries, since burning gas rather than coal to produce electricity emits half as much CO2 for the same amount of energy produced (see p. 44-45) . In this respect, setting objectives to drastically reduce TotalEnergies’ global indirect emissions (Scope 3) 2 in abso - lute value, without an evolution of the overall structure of energy demand, is in reality not relevant to reduce global GHG emissions. Most of the emissions reported under Scope 3 by Total- Energies correspond to the direct emissions (Scope 1) of the consumers of these products: the use of these products depends on their decisions and needs. In this context, an absolute reduction target for Scope 3 for a company like TotalEnergies, without any change in energy systems and therefore without the reduction of the corre - sponding Scope 1 of energy users, would lead to a shift of this demand towards other suppliers, notably the national oil companies of producing countries which account for more than 70% of the world market (compared with around 1.5% for TotalEnergies). This strategy would have no effect on lowering global green -house gas emissions, and therefore no positive impact on climate, and would be contrary to the interests of our Company and its shareholders. This strategy could be counter-productive for TotalEnergies’ customers, as the Company has set as a goal to ensure their energy supply security while supporting them in their own decarbonization journey. Reminder: under Scope 3, since 2016 TotalEnergies has reported Category 11 emissions related to the end use by its customers of products sold i.e., linked to their combus - tion to obtain energy. Since 2023, TotalEnergies has published an estimate of indi - rect emissions related to the other Scope 3 categories, in accordance with the classification used by the GHG Protocol and Ipieca.

42 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report 42 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report Helping our Customers Reduce their Own Emissions By 2030, the Company’s two-pillar balanced transi - tion strategy aims to result in a sales mix of energy products with the view to final use whose lifecyle carbon intensity of energy products sold 4 would be reduced by 25%, which means: • for an equivalent quantity of energy, the carbon content of energy products would be reduced by 25% (“less emis - sions for same energy”); • for an equivalent quantity of emissions (Scope 1+2+3), the Company would supply 33% more energy to its customers (“more energy for same emissions”). Furthermore, by 2030, energy products sold such as LNG and low-carbon electricity might contribute to enabled emis - sions reductions (“Scope4”) 3 of around 150 Mt CO2e (around 100 Mt CO2 c o m i n g f r o m G a s & L N G s a l e s a n d a r o u n d 50 Mt CO2 coming from Renewables), to be compared with a Scope 3 2 kept below 400 Mt CO2e. These reductions, which will result from our customers decisions to substitute more carbon-intensive energy products with less carbon-intensive ones, and therefore reduce their own Scope 1+2 (use of gas or renewables to generate electricity instead of fossil fuels), will definitely contribute to lower global GHG emissions. 1.

43 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report 43 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report Anticipating Changes in Demand by Adapting our Sales of Petroleum Products 2019 2023 20300 0,5 1,0 1,5 2,0 2,5 Asignificant part of TotalEnergies’ Downstream refining and marketing activities are located in Europe. The European Union with its Green Deal and its “Fit for 55” regulatory package, has the ambition to be the first carbon-neutral continent by 2050. These major trends are leading us to accelerate the transi - tion of our Downstream activities in Europe to reduce our exposure to petroleum products and to develop in new mobilities. Thus, at a global level, we expect to reduce our sales of petroleum products by 40% by 2030, so that we do not sell or refine more fuel than we produce oil. This means, in particular, that our service station networks will have to adapt to lower demand for fuels, notably through disposals in Europe. Conversely, this strategy is leading us to develop actively in new mobilities: in low-carbon molecules, we have initiated the conversion of refineries into biorefineries in Europe; in electric mobility, the Company is accelerating our growth with a plan to deploy charging points on major corridors and motorways and in large cities in Europe. In hydrogen, we are notably developing a European network of hydrogen stations for trucks, in partnership with Air Liquide.

44 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report 44 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report Reduction of Emissions Enabled by Our Sales of Gas Mt CO2eSCOPE 3 1 GAS AND ENABLED EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS ~ 70 Mt CO2e ENABLED EMISSION REDUCTION FOR OUR CUSTOMERS BY THE USE OF LNG2015 202360124 ~ 70 Scope 3 1 Gas Enabled emission reductionWe estimate that our customers’ use of LNG has enabled emissions reductions by about 70 Mt CO2e in 2023. Estimated enabled emissions reductions by renewable electricity sales by 2030 Similar approach as the one described above-mentioned has been taken to estimate enabled emissions reductions for our sales of renewable electricity: the methodology compares emissions from the country’s alternative non- renewable mix (following the methodology applied by IRENA) and the ones from solar and wind generation. The applied emission factors (published by IEA) cover the entire life cycle of power generation 6. Non-renewable production mixes are based on IEA 7 projections by country 8 or, if unavailable, by region 9. Thus, by 2030, the emissions reductions enabled by a portfolio of 100 GW of gross capacity have been esti - mated at around 50 Mt CO2e. Gas-fired power plants are a flexible resource for power generation and can be mobilized quickly; as a result, they offer a secure backup for grids designed to be powered increasingly by intermittent renew - able sources. CCGTs discharge half the greenhouse gases of the coal or fuel oil-powered plants 2 that still, in some countries, account for the majority of power generation capacity. The use of coal accounts for 36% of power gener - ation and 74% of GHG emissions associated with electricity, while natural gas accounts for 23% of generation and 22% of emissions 3. LNG, which can be shipped by sea, can flexibly supply many gas-fired power plants. A large percentage of the natural gas we sell goes to the electricity industry. Given the positive role played by natural gas, TotalEnergies is aiming to increase its share of the sales mix by 2030, and has made the decision not to set a gas Scope 3 1 reduction target. When fuel-oil or coal-fired power generation is replaced by gas-fired power generation, GHG emissions fall, whereas TotalEnergies’ gas Scope 3 1 increases. We have estimated the reductions of emissions enabled to which our 2023 sales of LNG may have contributed. To do that, we identified the likely competing source of flexible power generation for each LNG-receiving country. The calculation is based on generation mix and emission factors issued by Enerdata and IEA 4, for each country 5 and gener - ation mean. 1. GHG Protocol - Category 11.

In response, Integrated Power, a new pillar of the Company’s strategy, is developing an integrated model encompassing the entire value chain, from power generation to sales and trading activities, with a profitability target of 12% ROACE. TotalEnergies net electricity production target is to produce more than 100 TWh by 2030, thanks to a 4 to 5-fold increase in renewable production (19 TWh in 2023) and a 2-fold increase in flexible assets production (15 TWh in 2023). As part of its ambition to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, TotalEnergies is building a competitive portfolio of renewable (solar, onshore and offshore wind) and flexible (CCGT, storage) assets to provide its customers with less and less carbon-intensive electricity available 24/7.

49 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report 49 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report The energy transition also requires the development of low-carbon energy based on the conversion of biomass and waste or the production of e-fuels combining hydrogen with CO2 used as a raw material. TotalEnergies is thus developing these new energy: biofuels, biogas, hydrogen and e-fuels. Biofuels Today, biofuels emit 50% less CO2 than their fossil fuel equiv - alents 1, making them a decarbonization pathway for liquid fuels. Because demand is strong, this is a high-margin market, but access to feedstocks (plants, residues, sugar, etc.) remains a barrier to growth. Among these biofuels, TotalEnergies favors the production of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) to decarbonize the aviation industry. To avoid land use conflicts, TotalEnergies is developing solu - tions based on primarily food industry waste and residues (used oils, animal fats). Our aim is to increase the share of circular feedstocks to more than 75% as from 2024 in our production of biofuels (see p. 77) . Biogas Biogas, produced from the decomposition of organic waste, is a renewable gas. Injected into gas networks in the form of biomethane, it contributes to the decarbonization of natural gas uses. TotalEnergies’ gross production capacity of 1.1 TWh/year eq. biomethane has almost doubled compared with 2022.

Hydrogen and e-fuels Hydrogen. The production of green hydrogen will require the massive deployment of renewable electricity production capacities, to which TotalEnergies is contributing through its investments and the development of the Integrated Power segment (see p. 46) . For our operations, our priority is to Biogas Start-up of the BioBéarn plant in France in 2023, with a capacity of 160 GWh/year, equivalent to the average annual consumption of 32,000 inhabitants. It is one of the first plants in France to be awarded ISCC EU certification, guaranteeing the highest level of environmental performance in Europe. Since January 2024, 100% of our biomethane sites in France have been ISCC-certified. TotalEnergies has acquired Polska Grupa Biogazowa (PGB) - Poland’s leading biogas producer - which owns and operates 18 units in production and two under construction, for a total capacity of 166 GWh per year of renewable electricity production (0.4 TWh eq. CH4). Decarbonizing our European refineries As part of this ambition, in 2023 TotalEnergies signed agreements to supply green, low-carbon hydrogen to several of its sites (Normandie, Grandpuits, Leuna) and launched a tender for the supply of 500 kt/year of green hydrogen, which should enable it to avoid the emission of around 5 Mt/ year CO2 from its European refineries by 2030. These major projects contribute to the Company’s objective of reducing net greenhouse gas emissions directly related to its operations by 40% in 2030 compared with 2015. Decarbonization TotalEnergies and VNG (German natural gas distribution company) have signed an agreement for the future supply of green hydrogen to the Leuna refinery. This agreement contributes to the decarbonization of the site and will enable a reduction of up to 80,000 t/year of CO2 emissions by 2030. e-Gas TotalEnergies has joined forces with Tree Energy Solutions (TES) to study an industrial-scale “synthetic methane” production unit in the United States (100 to 200 kt/year), produced from renewable hydrogen and CO2 of biogenic origin, which can be transported and distributed using existing natural gas infrastructures.HIGHLIGHTS decarbonize the hydrogen consumed in our European refin - eries by 2030. TotalEnergies aims to replace carbon-based or grey hydrogen by green hydrogen, produced by electrolysis of water using electricity from renewable energy sources. Synthetic fuels, e-fuels CO2 can be combined, in reaction with renewable hydrogen, to produce synthetic fuels or gas. In 2023, TotalEnergies is setting milestones in its synthetic fuels roadmap.|page:51

51 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report 51 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report TotalEnergies intends to become a major player in the production of SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel), with a target of 1.5 Mt/year by 2030. This production is currently being developed on our existing platforms in Europe, the Middle East and Asia, notably Grandpuits, Normandie, La Mède and SATORP. Grandpuits The biorefinery is scheduled to come on stream in 2025. It will process 420 kt/year of feedstock, mainly waste and residues, to produce up to 285 kt/year of SAF by 2028. In 2022, TotalEnergies has joined forces with SARIA (European leader in the collection and valorization of organic materials into sustainable products) to guarantee the supply of lipidic feedstock. Normandy TotalEnergies plans to increase SAF production from 130 kt/ year in 2025 to 160 kt/year by 2027. La Mède Since 2022, biodiesel produced at La Mède has already been used to produce SAF at the TotalEnergies plant in Oudalle, near Le Havre. In 2024, TotalEnergies will continue to invest in the site, so as to be able to process up to 100% waste from the circular economy (used oils and animal fats) and will produce locally 14 kt/year of SAF by 2025.SATORP For the first time in the Middle East, SATORP has succeeded in co-processing used cooking oil to produce a fuel that meets all the quality criteria of the SAF ISCC+ certified spec - ifications. Partnerships In Japan, TotalEnergies has partnered with ENEOS Corpo - ration to study the feasibility of a SAF production unit at the ENEOS refinery in Wakayama. The planned unit, which would have a production capacity of 335 kt/year of SAF, would process waste or residues from the circular economy. In China, TotalEnergies is studying with its partner Sinopec the development of SAF production of around 230 kt/year. This unit would mainly process local residues and waste. Beyond the SAF currently produced from used cooking oil, our mission is to prepare the next generation of aviation fuels, such as e-SAF. Together with Masdar, the UAE Civil Aviation Authority, Airbus, Falcon Aviation Services and Axens, TotalEnergies has demon - strated the potential for converting methanol into SAF. Based on the use of renewable electricity, it could enable the produc - tion of e-SAF from CO2 converted into methanol. 1.

55 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report Our Just Transition Plan TotalEnergies is a major player in the energy transition. We are mindful of the issues related to a just transition raised by our activities and our own transformation to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, together with society, and we are providing concrete answers at the heart of our strategy and operations ( see table ). We are particularly sensitive to the need to enhance our employees’ skills, guarantee decent wages and maintain social dialogue, in the spirit of the International Labour Organization’s guiding principles on just transition and the Paris Agreement. We also take actions towards our customers, our suppliers and more generally the commu - nities and countries where we operate. How can we move to a sustainable development model that meets the vital needs of the planet’s 8 billion current inhabitants today, and over 8.5 billion by 20301, without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs? As the effects of global warming become more visible, nations are now faced with the essential task of a large-scale transformation, particularly of their energy systems. Beyond the technological and financial challenges it will pose, this transition process must be just if it is to succeed. It must provide the least developed countries with the clean, reliable and affordable energy they need for their growing populations aspiring to a higher standard of living. The most developed nations, in turn, will need to assist those who could be adversely affected by that transition, should for example their job disappear or the cost of this transition put them in energy poverty. 1.

61 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report 61 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report Ensuring People’s Safety Safety is more than a priority at TotalEnergies; it is a core value on which we will not compromise for any reason. Everyone who works at our sites must be able to return home safe and sound at the end of their workday. The Company has set a goal of “zero fatalities”, and is aiming for ongoing reductions in the number of accidents. Sadly, we recorded two accident-related fatalities in 2023 among contractors staff. An analysis of these cases led to specific action plans (see opposite) . Actions to prevent fatal accidents Our actions plans to prevent fatal accidents are based on long-term work to continuously adapt and systematically implement our two global programs in the field: “Our Lives First” and “The Golden Rules”. This indispensable funda - mental work is supplemented by specific action plans resulting from investigations carried out when new events occur. Worldwide roll-out of the “Our Lives First” program The program is designed to implement three types of prac - tical actions at all of our sites: • Life Saving Checks: five activities have been identified as generating the highest risks which could be the cause of fatal accidents. Safety checklists have been drafted for these activities, to check that work is carried out correctly in the field, in compliance with the safety rules;OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY 0,51,0 2023 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 2017 2016 2015Zeeland refinery, Netherlands - February 03, 2023 Torsten lost his life during a catalyst unloading operation in an inert atmosphere reactor. Despite the existence of strict rules, intervention by certified personnel and regular checks, this accident unfortunately occurred. We have decided to ban all entry into confined spaces under inert atmosphere for this type of activity. For each new intervention, alternative solutions have been developed, implemented at all TotalEnergies-operated sites and communicated within the industry’s safety networks. Service station Montpellier, France - May 05, 2023 Isidore was struck by a metal beam he was guiding while handling it with a mechanical shovel. This activity was part of the installation of shoring to consolidate an excavation for the installation of underground wastewater recycling equipment. For these high-risk jobs, work supervision measures at the service stations were stepped up: a TotalEnergies representative is required to be present in the field, detailed procedures specific to each work site were systematically drawn up, and monitoring cameras are now being used. The lessons learned from this event were shared with all those involved in the field.TOTALENERGIES TRIR Total recordable injury rate per million hours worked. The number of injuries per million hours worked (TRIR) for Company employees and contractors has improved regularly for many years.

62 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report 62 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report • Joint Safety Tours: front-line presence and safety dialogue have been enhanced to promote a shared safety culture. Joint safety tours with TotalEnergies senior management and contractor partners are held in addition to daily visits from local management; • Safety Green Light: the goal is to ensure that the intervening teams understand the risks involved, notably of a fatal accident, before starting work. To this end, a ritual of ques - tions associated with the work permit was integrated into the Our Lives First program from the outset. After two years of practice, we carried out an observation phase to capitalize on feedback and assess the level of adoption. As a result, the form of the document has been revised, and the objec - tives and expectations clarified. The revised version of the Safety Green Light will be rolled out to all Company sites in 2024. PREVENTING MAJOR TECHNOLOGICAL RISKS AND ACCIDENTAL POLLUTIONS TotalEnergies’ facilities and activities are exposed to tech - nological risks, and the prevention of major industrial acci - dents is an essential part of the Company’s safety policy. All our facilities are subject to systematic studies to identify hazards and analyze the associated risks, with the aim of controlling risks in order to prevent a major accident, to protect people, the environment and assets. All risks are studied, and technical-, organizational- and human barriers are identified and implemented to guarantee risk control. In 2023, a multi-year plan has been initiated to continue strengthening the control of major technological risks for all field operatives. This program has 3 main focuses: • reassess the effectiveness of critical barrier management for each major accident scenario. • facilitate the management of major risks by visualizing critical barriers. • improve understanding and management of prevention tools for operational staff. On April 28, 2023, World Safety Day, the prevention of major technological risks was the theme of discussions and presen - tations were made to all employees of the Company and partner companies. We track Tier 1 and Tier 2 losses of primary containment, as defined by the industry standards. The prevention policy we have implemented, based on managing technical integ - rity and operational excellence, has resulted in a four-fold decrease since 2015. The Company did not experience any major industrial accidents in 2023. 050100150 2023 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 2017 2016 2015TOTALENERGIES NUMBER OF TIER 1 AND TIER 2 INCIDENTS (SEE OPPOSITE) An indicator of the number of losses of primary containment as defined in the API and IGOP standards (excluding acts of sabotage and theft), Tier 1 incidents being those that may have the most serious consequences.200,000 Life Saving Checks 10,000 Joint Safety Tours 100% of sites deployed the Safety Green Light OUR LIVES FIRST PROGRAM “Our Lives First” program across the Company, in 2023:|page:63

63 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report 63 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report ROAD TRANSPORTATION The risk of road accidents is one of the main safety risks at the workplace for TotalEnergies. The Company has for many years had a policy based on rules, driver training, communi - cation, technical vehicle specifications and an extensive carrier inspection program. This policy has led to a steady decline in the number of accidents. The number of serious accidents has been divided by 6 since 2015. To prevent road accidents, several techno - logical innovations have been tested, implemented as a priority in countries with high road risk and we have decided to extend them to all countries where the Company operates. These technologies are: • lane departure warning system; • forward collision warning; • advanced emergency breaking; • fatigue and distraction detection.

64 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report 64 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report Our Employees at the Heart of the Transition Our employees are at the heart of our performance, and their engagement is essential to the success of our transition. Our people ambition Better Together brings together a set of measures to make the Company a good place to work together, and to lead a just transition. We believe that listening to our stakeholders is an essential part of the just transition, and this is achieved through social dialogue and participatory approaches with our employees. Every two years, our employees around the world take part in the TotalEnergies survey to understand their perception of the Company along different themes (the Company ambition, collective performance, management, talent development, working conditions, etc.). On the Executive Committee’s decision, a complementary and more concise survey was launched in 2023, the Total - Energies Pulse Survey, which will now take place alternately every other year, to enable the measurement of employee engagement and well-being, on an annual basis. In 2023, the engagement score for TotalEnergies was 82.4%, up 2 points from 2022 1. After the invitation of 300 young employees in 2022, nearly 300 employees aged 35 to 45 were invited in 2023 to discuss and debate with members of the Executive Committee and senior executives on key topics for the Company. In 2024, the program for the next campus will focus on technical professions. 2023 TOTALENERGIES ENGAGEMENT SCORE 71.3 Benchmark82.4 TotalEnergiesIPSOS Benchmark composed of companies larger than 10,000 employees throughout the world.

65 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report 65 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report TotalEnergies’ ambition calls for the mobilization of its employees. In 2022, more than 27,000 of them participated in the development of 10 objec - tives and indicators linked to the United Nations Sustain - able Development Goals (SDGs), organized around 4 axes: climate and sustainable energy, employees’ well-being, care for the environment and positive impact for our stake - holders. Together, they form the Sustainab’ALL program (see p. 70) . In 2023, nearly 250 sites, business units, departments or subsidiaries of the Company worldwide, representing over 94% of employees1, have committed to a 3-year action plan for each of the 10 indicators, with targets to be reached by 2025. These action plans are linked to the activities of the entity concerned, and its specific local features. The aim of this program is to mobilize the entire Company around the Sustainable Development Goals. With Sustain - ab’ALL, we want to show that every subsidiary, site or entity can contribute to the SDGs, and that the SDGs enable us to participate in the Company’s transition. On October 6, 2023, the Company organized the first global day dedicated to the Sustainab’ALL program and the chal - lenges of sustainable development. This event, which took place in all entities, sites and local business units, brought together more than 34,000 employees, who were able to Engaging Every Employee 1.

For example, our naval architecture experts are now deploying their skills on our new offshore wind farm construction and installation sites. Attracting, Developing and Retaining Talents Developing everyone’s skills is a major challenge for a just transition. Our goal is to empower all employees to take charge of their career development, notably through the internal mobility platform, or to freely decide which training courses they consider important for their development, up to three days per year, in addition to manda - tory training. Launched in 2022, the Transforming with our people program has enabled us, over a 2-year period, to support the skills development of our employees with the “Visa for Total - Energies” training program (see p. 64) , and the “live round - tables”, which over 18 months, between January 2022 and July 2023, have highlighted 32 key projects that illustrate the opportunities offered by the energy transition. The OneTech branch, which brings together 3,400 engineers, technicians and researchers from the various sectors of the Company, has created a hub of technological excellence serving all the Company’s multi-energy activities. The concen - tration of technical skills makes it possible to build multidis - ciplinary teams to carry out new industrial projects, regard - less of the sector of activity. This decompartmentalization of skills thus strengthens the operational excellence of the Company. In 2023, the engineers of the Technologies depart - ment worked on average on more than 11 different assets, divided between the exploration and production of hydro - carbons, refining, electricity, renewables or low-carbon fuels, thus increasing opportunities to develop their skills and AVERAGE NUMBER OF TRAINING DAYS PER YEAR AND PER EMPLOYEE 4.75 4.2 2021 2023 2022 Top 10 COMPANIES PREFERRED BY YOUNG MANAGERS IN FRANCE ACCORDING TO THE ANNUAL RANKINGS ESTABLISHED BY THE UNIVERSUM AGENCYWE ARE ONE OF THE UPSKILLING COURSES DEVELOPED OVER 2 YEARS IN ORDER TO OFFER EMPLOYEES THE ACCURATE TRAINING TO MOVE INTO OTHER TECHNICAL DISCIPLINES23Acquisitions: integrating new skills Our ambition to rank among the top 5 producers of wind and solar energy, and to become an integrated electricity player, led us, in 2023, to acquire companies specializing in renewable energies with Total Eren, biogas with Polska Grupa Biogazowa in Poland, agrivoltaics with Ombrea in France and renewable energies aggregation in Germany with Quadra Energy. These acquisitions will enable us to meet our growth challenges and integrate the skills of nearly 700 people, essential to the energy transition to which we are committed. To retain these talents and strengthen their sense of belonging, we have set up a comprehensive onboarding program, harmonized in France and internationally. It includes all the information needed to understand how the Company and the Gas, Renewables & Power Division work, how to develop everyone’s individual talents, as well as face -to-face events to encourage live encounters and exchanges between teams.HIGHLIGHTS|page:67

67 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report 67 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report The Company’s commitment to social responsibility is reflected in the Care Together by TotalEnergies program. In addition to commitments specific to each affiliate, this program guarantees compliance with high social standards for all its employees worldwide, regardless of the legislation in force in any given country. Remarkable for its scope, this program is based on concrete measures revolving around four essential pillars: social protection, health, the family sphere and working conditions. For example, every employee worldwide has access to medical monitoring, health insurance and a death benefit plan, and childcare leave. In terms of mental health, the Company has a worldwide policy of preventing psychosocial risks (see table on next page) . With the aim of developing a culture that fosters well-being on a daily basis, we help our employees to preserve their balance in a safe working environment, by reinforcing the attention that everyone pays to the well-being of their colleagues and encouraging local managers to create a working environment conducive to sustainable perfor - mance. We are thus providing our employees with a specific training offer within a framework that, since early 2023, has enabled every employee to take three days of training of his or her choice. Since 2023, the Company has been running “Green Fridays”. This innovation liberates calendar from any collective meetings scheduled by management every other Friday, and allow employees to organize their work.

Being inclusive means taking into account all talents within a team, and recognizing that we need all talents. It’s the key to making a success of the transition to which we are collectively committed, without leaving anyone behind. Understanding our differences In 2023, Inclusion Talks awareness campaigns were held around a variety of themes: LGBTQIA+, unconscious bias, the place of women in the transformation, inclusive manage - ment, domestic violence… These talks help everyone to take ownership of these issues, and demonstrate the links between these subjects and the Company. Testimonials from employees in different subsidiaries around the world also illustrated that inclusion is shaped by the culture and history of different countries. Acting for the disabled Since 2018, we have joined the International Labour Organi - zation (ILO) network, committing ourselves to promoting as a priority, 5 major principles of the Global Business and Disability Network Charter. To date, 41 Company subsidiaries have committed to creating a more inclusive working envi - ronment for employees with disabilities, while respecting the specific features of each country. % Non-French nationals among senior executives% Non-French nationals among senior management% of women among senior executives% of women among senior managementDiversity 2025 roadmap: Ongoing progress EVOLUTION OF INTERNATIONALIZATION 1.

71 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report 71 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report Day: a collective success This year, the Company celebrated its first Sustai - nab’ALL Day, a day dedicated to the program that gives concrete expression to our contribution to sustainable development. Each site organized activities and events adapted to its context and priorities. Here’s a selection from each site. • For sustainable energy growth, at Normandie in France: on this occasion, all eyes turned to the platform’s future, thanks to the organization of an information session on the project with Air Liquide to install an electrolyzer and supply green hydrogen to the Compagnie’s facilities. • Reducing our carbon footprint, in La Défense, France: IT teams got together to carry out a major clean-up of their IT tools. The result: 132 participants, 12 workshops, 80 kg of IT equipment collected, 6 terabytes of data deleted and advice shared. • Involving employees in the transition to sustainable de - velopment in Singapore: the Sustainab’ALL Day was not 1 day, but 3. A marathon event for teams, who were able to discover and share the Company’s sustainable development objectives, through round tables, screenings and aware - ness-raising workshops. • Preserving natural resources in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, where our teams took action in favor of the environment OneTech Graduate Program, a talent integration accelerator In 2022, TotalEnergies welcomed the first class of the OneTech Graduate Program to its OneTech branch. This integration-accelerating program of - fers 60 young engineers of 23 nationalities, the majority of whom were women, the opportunity to gain initial experience in all areas of energy, from oil and gas to electricity (solar, wind, batteries, gas power plants) and low-carbon molecules (hydrogen and biogas). This two-year program is structured around 3 successive 8-month assignments, including at least one in a Research and Development entity. A special feature of the program is the rapid recruitment process, which encourages exchanges with the Company’s managers and experts; cross-functional learning expeditions and tailor-made assignments to meet operational needs. The result: creating a collective of young multi-energy en - gineers, for whom accelerated learning of the Company’s challenges and the building of a network are an essential factor of integration. Building on the success and attractive - ness of the program, a new class of 30 graduates will be recruited in October 2024, for a new two-year OneTech Graduate Program. STORIES and biodiversity. On the program: clean-up and waste col - lection in teams on the beach. Objective: to protect the mangroves and wildlife of the Jebal Ali marine sanctuary. • Creating shared value by increasing local content: this is the objective that teams working on the Begonia project in Angola wanted to celebrate at Sustainab’ALL Day.

73 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report 73 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report Caring for the Environment Nature provides a large range of services, known as “ecosystem services”, which are directly or indi - rectly necessary for all human activities on earth. W e are one of the many players who depend on these services. What’s more, like all human activities, our opera - tions have an impact on ecosystems. In 2022, the world adopted a Global Biodiversity Framework, with quantified targets for States by 2030. We support this ambitious and concrete agreement. It also calls on compa - nies to be transparent across their value chain. This agree - ment highlights the importance of nature in the broadest sense. It recalls the link between climate and biodiversity, climate change being listed by the IPBES (Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services) as the third leading cause of biodiversity loss. Our ambition is to place environmental performance at the heart of our projects and operations. For us, it’s a question of operational excellence. In concrete terms, this means developing our activities, including renewable ones, while protecting the environments in which we operate, in partic - ular by limiting our discharges. It means taking into account the freshwater issue and there - fore the preservation of water bodies in our upstream and downstream operations. It means being a player in circularity by developing recovery channels for the waste from our sites, and by making a concrete contribution to this “resource TotalEnergies is a member of the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) forum and took part in the pilot for the energy sector coordinated by the WBCSD1 and PwC2 . We shared the feedback from our pilot widely with TNFD members on the sidelines of COP 15 Biodiversity, with Ipieca3 and at a meeting organized by EpE and the Institut de la Finance Durable in 2023. With a view to implementing the CSRD (Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive), the Company has also begun mapping its Nature- related Dependencies, Impacts, Risks and Opportunities. The first elements of this analysis, shared with the Company’s main Business Units, highlight the following points:• the dependence of its installations on water resources (refineries, petrochemical sites, CCGT), on the availability of land (direct for solar farms and indirect for its feedstock of agricultural origin), and on weather conditions (renewable farms); • the impacts linked to its greenhouse gas emissions, potential pollution, its physical footprint, for example for the establishment of wind farms; • the risks associated with extreme climatic events, water stress and rising land prices; • opportunities for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, CO2 capture and sequestration, reduction of plastic pollution, improvement of biodiversity, reduction in the use of chemical fertilizers (biogas digestate).TASKFORCE ON NATURE-RELATED FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES (TNFD)efficiency” particularly through our production of circular polymers.

Preventing the risk of accidental pollution We apply the highest standards to reduce the risks inherent to the nature of our activities: • maritime and river transport of hydrocarbons; selection and vetting of chartered vessels in accordance with the best international standards (OCIMF and EBIS) and use of Marine Terminal Management and Self Assessment (MTMSA) in operated terminals; • Implementation of a Company-wide crisis management system to deal with a major accidental spill, backed up in the field by regular mandatory exercises to test the pollution control plans of Company-operated sites at risk of spills reaching surface water. In 2023, training and a specific exercise were organized for TotalEnergies’ Sea Transport activities, based in Singapore, Geneva and Paris, with the intervention in Singapore of the Oil Spill Response Ltd center. Reducing our industrial discharges Our activities generate emissions such as combustion fumes, atmospheric emissions from transformation processes and water discharges.Environmental Protection The Company often goes beyond compliance with applicable regulations to limit the quantities discharged into the various environments: • Sulphur dioxide (SO2) Target of 75% reduction in emissions between 2015 and 2030. By 2023, we have reduced these emissions to 12 kt SO2, a reduction of 80% compared to 2015. • Discharge of hydrocarbons into water In January 2022, the Company set itself a new target for the quality of water discharged from our onshore sites by 2030. Compared with the previous target of 15 mg/l, it divides by 15 the maximum hydrocarbon content expected for these discharges. To date, 100% of onshore sites comply with the previous 15 mg/l target, and 86% with the reinforced 1 mg/l target introduced in 2022. Studies have been launched to improve discharges from sites that have not yet met the new target. At our offshore sites, the average hydrocarbon content of water discharges is 11.6 mg/l, well below our objective of keeping it below 30 mg/l. 1.

75 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report 75 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report In 2022, we joined the CEO Water Mandate, part of the United Nations Global Compact, joining a platform of over 200 companies committed to advancing water management. Our 2023 actions are in line with this mandate. Reducing freshwater withdrawals in our direct operations Freshwater represents 7% of the water used at our operated sites, and we have decided to focus our efforts on this unevenly distributed resource on the planet that we share with our neighbors. Our target is to reduce our overall1 freshwater withdrawals by 20% at sites located in water-stressed zones2 between 2021 and 2030. In 2023, we have reassessed the priority sites on the basis of updated projections from WRI’s Aque - duct tool. Eleven priority sites are now covered by this target3, with the inclusion of one of the combined-cycle power generation plants acquired in Texas in early 2024. Located mainly in Western Europe, they represent, in 2023, 49% of the Company’s total freshwater withdrawals, i.e. 50 Mm3. In 2023, the sites concerned launched detailed studies to reduce their freshwater withdrawals, in line with our 2030 target. Our Antwerp platform, for example, has a plan to reduce its freshwater consumption by 65%, replacing it by water from the Antwerp municipal wastewater treatment plant. The La Mède biorefinery has put in place a plan to Taking Action to Preserve Water Resources reduce its water withdrawal by 50% by 2030 by optimizing its processes and installing a variable flow pump. Contributing to collective programs The French government’s Water Plan (March 2023): we are contributing with water-saving plans for our sites at Donges (Loire-Atlantique), La Mède and SOBEGI (Pau region). Eco d’Eau: we joined in December 2023 this collective initiative by French companies to promote sustainable water management and in 2024 will be raising awareness of eco-gestures among our employees and customers at our truck stops in France. Mobilizing industrial players: we participate in the work of the Ipieca working group on water and welcomed its members in October 2023 for a sharing of best practices . 1. 20% is the target integrated in the reduction for each of the site. This is an initial approach aligned with the definition of water stress. 2. Water-stressed zone 2030: Water-stress zones as defined by WRI (zones in which withdrawals exceed 40% of available resources). 3. Sites con- cerned: our refineries at Normandie, Grandpuits and La Mède (France), Leuna (Germany), Feluy and Antwerp (Belgium), the CCGTs at Marchienne-au-Pont (Belgium) and Pont-sur-Sambre (France), and Castejón (Spain) as well as Wharton (USA), and our operated assets at Barnett (USA). These sites represent 97% of our withdrawals in water-stressed areas. These sites are located in the following watersheds: Maas and Scheldt (Belgium), Seine, Côtes Ouest and Sud (France), Elbe (Germany), Ebro (Spain) and Gulf Coast (USA).SIMPLIFIED MAP OF WATER-STRESS AREAS IN 2030 Location of sites in water-stressed areas in Europe.

76 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report 76 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report Seawater treatment plant project in Iraq In Iraq, to maintain reservoir pressure in the oil fields of southern Iraq, oil operators are currently drawing large quan - tities of water from the country’s two main rivers (the Tigris and the Euphrates) and from aquifers. The project for the sustainable development of natural resources in the Basra region, entrusted to TotalEnergies by the Iraqi authorities, includes the construction of a seawater treatment plant at Khor Zubair with a capacity of 290 million m3 per year. This project will reduce water stress on the two rivers, which supply water to the local population and agri - culture, while providing the volume of water needed to main - tain pressure on the oil fields in southern Iraq. Promoting access to fresh water for local populations Access to water is fundamental to local development. As part of our fuel distribution activities in Africa, we run several Water Sanitation And Hygiène (WASH) programs to provide access to water for local communities in connection with our operations. In Kenya, our Marketing Services subsidiary experimented in 2023 leasing space in service stations to Glug, a local company specializing in water supply, to distribute drinking water to neighboring communities by digging wells and installing a water treatment system. In Mozambique, we support actions aimed at guaranteeing equitable access to drinking water and improving sanitation and hygiene services for all local communities. Since the start of the program, 75,000 people have benefited from the rehabilitation of over 100 water sources in the districts of Palma and Mocímboa da Praia, which are now managed by local communities.

77 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report 77 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report Making progress in the circularity of our products and waste is another way of reducing our envi - ronmental footprint. We do this through our production of biofuels, biogas and circular polymers. At our sites, promoting the circular management of resources starts with responsible management of our waste. Valorizing waste from our sites In early 2022, we have set ourselves the goal of valorizing over 70% of our waste. Our approach, based on the “Reduce - Reuse - Recycle – Recover” principle, has enabled us to recover 61% of waste from our operated sites by 2023. This is the same ratio as in 2022. This is due to the long timeframes we take to develop new processes. To meet our objective, we are setting up demanding waste management contracts and partnerships with international waste treatment companies, both in France and in our host countries. This contributes to the local development of waste treatment industries in the countries where we operate. Lastly, we integrate the issue of resource saving into the value chain with our suppliers (see p. 94) . Creating value from circular raw materials For biofuel production, we have set ourselves the target of increasing the share of circular feedstocks (waste oils, animal fats) to over 75% by 2024. Biogas is mainly produced from agricultural waste (see p. 49-50) . Our goal is to reach a capacity of 20 TWh biomethane equivalent by 2030 (i.e. 10 TWh of production in TotalEnergies’ share).Developing Circular Management of Our Products CREATING VALUE FROM CIRCULAR RAW MATERIALS Reduce • Recycle • Double the quantity of circular raw materials entering our facilities by 2030. • Achieve 75% waste and residues in our biofuel production by 2024. • Produce 2 TWh of biogas by 2025, mainly from waste, with a target of 10 TWh in 2030 (eq 20 TWh in 100% capacity). PRODUCING RESPONSIBLY Reduce • Reuse • Recycle • 70% recovery of waste from our sites.

78 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report 78 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report Circular polymers at the heart of our strategy Increasing the circularity of our polymers is essential in the fight against plastic pollution. We offer our customers a range of RE:clic low-carbon polymers: RE:clic organized around 3 product lines RE:use, polymers containing mechanically recycled plastic. Our subsidiary Synova is the leader on the French market, supplying high-performance recycled poly - mers to markets such as the automotive industry. RE:build, polymers manufactured by chemical recycling, which converts non-mechanically recyclable waste into raw materials. Chemically recycled polymers can be used for food applications, for example. We currently produce chemically recycled polymers at our Antwerp (Belgium) platform, from pyrolysis oil produced in Belgium by Indaver or in Spain by our partner Plastic Energy. Since 2020, we have been working with Plastic Energy to build a waste plastic recycling unit in Grandpuits (France). In 2022, we entered into a partnership with New Hope Energy to promote the chemical recycling of plastics in the United States. RE:newable, our range of biopolymers. TotalEnergies is developing new polymers based on vegetable oils and used edible oils processed at the La Mède biorefinery in France, and tomorrow at the Grandpuits biorefinery. The TotalEnergies Corbion joint venture produces PLA (polylactic acid), a biosourced, recyclable and biocompostable bioplastic, at its 75 kt/year plant in Rayong (Thailand). We are also working with our stakeholders to reduce the global footprint of plastics: • we develop “ecodesign” solutions to reduce the amount of material needed for packaging and enable the recycling of plastic waste at the end of its life cycle (monomaterials);• we support regulatory initiatives aimed at banning certain single-use plastic applications; • we are rolling out the Operation Clean Sweep certification program, which aims to prevent the loss of pellets to the environment throughout the plastics value chain; • we are involved in coalitions such as the Alliance to End Plastic Waste, of which we are a founding member and which brings together players in the plastics value chain, from the production of raw materials to waste collection, to work on solutions to eliminate plastic waste in the envi - ronment.

79 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report 79 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report Recycling platforms of the L7 offshore natural gas field in the Netherlands In 2017, after 40 years of production, TotalEnergies in the Netherlands ceased operations at the L7 natural gas field, one of the country’s very first offshore fields. As part of the site handover, 97% of the waste was transported to AF offshore Decom’s environ - mental base in Vats, Norway in 2023. This represents almost 19,000 tonnes of material (the equivalent of 2 Eiffel Towers!) which will be reused for dedicated projects (CO2 capture and storage, road construction…) or reconverted into raw materials (steel, copper, compost…) for marketing purposes. Incorporation of recycled plastic in our product containers In France, Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, since September 2023, all our 5-liter AdBlue® cans contain 50% recycled plastic from a recycling unit run by our partner Emb-I-Pack. We are now working to develop a collection system at our French service stations, to create a complete recycling loop. In 2023, AdBlue® sales represented over 2.5 millions cans in more than 60 countries. Since September 2023, TotalEnergies Lubrifiants’ European range of premium products has been packaged in plati - num-colored cans containing 50% post-consumer recycled plastic (PCR), notably produced at our Antwerp plant and part of the RE:clic range of circular polymers. The resulting cans have the same design and weight as 100% fossil bott - les. Since February 2024, TotalEnergies and its partner Be - ricap have also been marketing bottle-caps incorporating 50% PCR for 20-liter lubricant packaging. Developing local waste treatment processes in Africa In 2023, we started our first local plastics recycling facility in Nigeria, as part of a project supported by UNITAR (United Nations Institute for Training and Research) and the Nigerian authorities. The construction of 2 additional facilities is scheduled for 2024, and the possibility of collecting plastic waste from rivers is currently under study. Pellets packaged in recycled bags TotalEnergies Premium wood pellets are now packaged in polyethylene bags containing 50% post-consumer recycled material. This innovative packaging consists of a central layer of 100% recycled polyethylene and 2 outer layers of virgin resins. Its properties are identical to those of fossil alternatives. The printed surface of the packaging has been reduced to improve recyclability and limit ink use. STORIES|page:80

80 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report 80 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report Acting for biodiversity is a driver for collective action across our sites, and is the subject of an ambition and concrete objectives1 in four areas (see opposite) . Our approach is to conciliate the development of energy resources with the protection of biodiversity to build a sustain - able future. We apply the Mitigation Hierarchy to all our operations and projects: Avoid, Minimize, Restore, Offset. In concrete terms, we implement an environmental impact assessment for all our projects, including renewable energy projects, in all the countries where we operate. A voluntary continuous improvement approach Our ambition is based on the Act4Nature International volun - tary commitments2, made in 2018. We have also added a target of “zero net deforestation” for each of our projects on new sites in 2022. We use the United Nations definition of “forest” 3, and we compensate on the basis of surface (hect - ares). With our Sustainab’ALL program launched in 2023, our commitment to deploy actions to support biodiversity now applies to all our operated sites. Acting for Biodiversity 1.

81 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report 81 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report Our progress in 2023 In 2023, we have respected our voluntary exclusion zones. We are deploying eight biodiversity action plans on our new projects and operated production sites located in the most sensitive protected areas, notably for our Tilenga project, for which we are committed to having a net gain on biodiversity. Our other net gain projects are EACOP in Uganda and Tanzania, Ratawi in Iraq, Mozambique LNG and Papua LNG. We have also completed 26 biodiversity surveys at our existing environmentally signficant sites in 2023, bringing our 2025 target to 90% completion. The associated action plans are currently being rolled out. Biodiversity assess - ments have also been carried out at 12 brownfield sites, 2 of which have already initiated associated action plans. In 2023, the TotalEnergies Foundation supported 10 proj - ects, including a dune restoration pilot project in France. Six datasets from our projects in Namibia, Papua New Guinea and Brazil were shared on the international GBIF5 platform. Since 2020, data shared on this platform by the Company have been cited in 119 scientific publications. Zero Net Deforestation objective: in 2023, our new projects required the deforestation of 81 ha. 59 ha of forest were replanted during the year. Offsetting actions on a solar project in the United States, corresponding to the balance, are scheduled for 2024. Our collaborations for nature On these complex topics of biodiversity, we collaborate with scientific partners to ensure that our operations take biodiversity into account: • Uganda: partnership with a NGO and local communities to restore forest connectivity by replanting 350 ha between two forest blocs in the Bugoma-Budongo corridor, the natural habitat of chimpanzee populations. • Indicators: continuation of work based on UNEP-WCMC’s Biodiversity Indicator for Sites Impacts (BISI) method - ology is supported by an independent critical review committee made up of representatives of international institutions and NGOs6. We are also working with IUCN, as part of the REN2 program, on assessing the impacts of renewable energies. • R&D: continued development of the environmental DNA program in partnership with the Centre des Espaces Naturels de Nouvelle-Aquitaine.

82 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report 82 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report Protecting lizards and trees in arid environments (GRP – Qatar) The Al Kharsaah solar power plant in Qatar, with a capacity of 800 MWp, has implemented voluntary measures in favor of biodiversity. Ecological surveys were carried out prior to construction, identifying the presence of spiny-tailed lizards (Agama lizard) and Ghaf trees, both with vulnerable IUCN status, as well as other tree species. An action plan was put in place to protect them, including the relocation of over 100 lizards and the reloca - tion of 140 trees. These actions have made it possible to preserve biodiversity while developing a sustainable energy infrastructure. Creation of an ecological corridor (RC Feluy– Belgium) The creation of an ecological corridor between two forest areas on the Feluy site in Belgium is a voluntary action aimed at restoring connectivity between these natural spaces. By linking two isolated forest areas with a corridor of native trees and shrubs, the edge habitat for local fauna has been extended, contributing to the conservation of the Nightingale and the brown long-eared bat for which the edge is a favored hunting ground. Mobilizing our employees • Biodiversity awareness raising of 2,722 employees during Sustainab’ALL day and mobilization of 3,809 employees who took part in actions to support biodiversity as part of the Action! program. • Creation of an in-house ’One Biodiversity’ platform bringing together all the tools (guides, awareness-raising materials, decision-making tools, training courses, sharing of best prac - tices) to enhance the Biodiversity Action Plans at our sites. • Launch of The Biodiversity Collage facilitator’s network to deploy this awareness raising tool throughout the Company (60 employees trained in 2023). • TotalEnergies Marketing France has set up a Biodiversity Ambassador Network made of 200 volunteer employees.

84 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report 84 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report HUMAN RIGHTS IN THE WORKPLACEHUMAN RIGHTS AND SECURITY HUMAN RIGHTS AND LOCAL COMMUNITIES Respect for each other is a core value at TotalEnergies, at the heart of our collective ethics and our Code of Conduct. The Code of Conduct applies to all our employees, as well as to our suppliers and contractors. Respect for each other means respect for human rights, which are non-negotiable in our operations around the world. It is also a collective and individual requirement. Our salient risks of impacting human rights break down into three categories: Human rights in the workplace We take action against all forms of discrimination, forced labor and child labor; ensure fair, satisfactory and safe working conditions (see p.60 and following) and require the same of our suppliers in their operations (see p. 94) . In the field, we emphasize training to explain, anticipate and prevent human rights risks. In 2023, more than 3,500 employees participated in classroom training and since 2019, more than 69,000 have received online training. We are also engaged in conducting external audits of our affiliates using the consulting firm GoodCorporation. In 2023, 4 assessments were conducted (Vietnam, Morocco, South Africa and Congo), and an audit plan targeting 300 suppliers was launched, with the aim of reaching 1,300 audited suppliers by the end of 2025. From 2016 to date, 740 potentially high-risk suppliers in terms of human Upholding Human Rights rights have been audited, in 86 countries, involving 100 affil - iates and covering 230,000 people. 385 of these required the implementation of corrective measures. Human rights and local communities In our project development process, we conduct specific due diligence as soon as studies begin to identify the poten - tial negative impacts of our activities on local communities, as well as appropriate remediation plans, in accordance with the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGP). We pay particular attention to salient risks concerning access to land, the right to health and an adequate standard of living. We are setting up mechanisms to manage grievances in our affiliates. Human rights and safety When security contractors or government forces in charge of protecting our employees and installations have to inter - vene, we make sure they have been vetted individually and received adequate training. In 2023, over 900 people have been trained in this way. We perform analyses each year to assess the security risks at our sites and publish an annual VPSHR report1.OUR SALIENT RISKS OUR COMMITMENTS Our values and Code of Conduct Compliance with international standards and principles: • Universal Declaration of Human Rights • United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGP) • Fundamental Conventions of the ILO• Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights (VPSHR) • The OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises 1.

86 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report 86 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report We work with governments to promote fiscal trans - parency and fight corruption, helping to create the right environment for economic development. Promoting fiscal transparency TotalEnergies is a member of the Extractive Industries Trans - parency Initiative (EITI) and made its tax policy public in 2014. This policy is approved by the Board of Directors and published in the Company’s Universal Registration Document. We also publicly endorse the Responsible Tax Principles developed by the B Team, a non-profit organization of business leaders and civil society representatives, which aims to promote sustainable economic and social development. The Company published in April 2023 its second fiscal trans - parency report, providing additional information on the taxes paid in its main host countries in 2021 and 2022, in order to give its stakeholders a fuller and more pertinent view of its tax situation. Fighting corruption TotalEnergies is exposed to corruption risks owing to its presence in certain countries that have a high perceived level of corruption according to the index drawn up by Transparency International. We apply a principle of zero tolerance for corrup - tion among our employees and suppliers.

87 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report 87 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report Our activities have a significant effect on society, and directly or indirectly concern a very large number of stakeholders. With growing expectations of busi - nesses, legitimate questions are raised about our strategy, how we implement it and the impact it has. We firmly believe that we need dialogue, and strive to provide honest and useful answers to the questions we are asked about what we do. We take part in existing bodies that facilitate this dialogue and we create them when necessary to anticipate expectations, particularly those of our local stakeholders. On the ground, all over the world, we work hand in hand with local NGOs. These relationships, most of which receive little media coverage, enable us to identify and respond to priority needs, and contribute to taking a responsible approach in our operations. TotalEnergies is also a member of a number of coalitions and think-tanks committed to advancing corporate sustain - ability, such as the WBSCD, the Global Compact, CSR Europe, ORSE, Comité 211 and EpE (Entreprises pour l’Environnement). From the most local to the most global level, dialogue helps to identify and analyze the main risks and impacts relating Engaging with Our Stakeholders to our activities, as well as giving a better understanding of the complex challenges involved and the sometimes contra - dictory expectations we have to deal with, and to identifying opportunities for collaboration. Discussion between local and central teams, as well as regular monitoring and tracking of social trends, provides us with a global understanding of the challenges at stake, to feed the Company’s strategy. We organize informal discussion channels in order to dialogue with all stakeholders, including the most critical, in a context of growing polarization of opinion. As a result, we pay partic - ular attention to any controversies raised, which usually reflect unmet expectations, whether or not it is within our power to provide a response.MAPPING OF OUR MAIN STAKEHOLDERS PUBLIC AUTHORITIES Host countries Authorities Administrations CIVIL SOCIETY Neighboring and local communities Institutions and multilateral agencies Universities and research centers Experts and researchers NGOs Media ECONOMIC SPHERE Employees and their representatives Investors and shareholders, Rating agencies Customers - Suppliers Professional associations 1.

88 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report 88 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report The main controversies that we faced in 2023 related to: • our strategy to get to Net Zero by 2050, together with society, the pace and the reality of our transition; • our climate impact, and particularly that of new oil and gas production projects; • the role of Nature-Based Solutions projects in our Net Zero strategy; • LNG’s role in ensuring security of supply in Europe, and in France in particular; • human rights and the impact of our activities on local communities, particularly those concerned in Uganda and Tanzania by the Tilenga-EACOP projects; in Mozambique; • our activities in relation with Russia; • the impact of our operations on the environment and health; • the Company’s rate of taxation, its profits and dividends paid, and the amount redistributed to its employees. Social Dialogue: an essential commitment to the success of our transition TotalEnergies encourages and maintains regular dialogue with employees and their representatives. In countries where employee representation is not mandatory under local legis - lation, the creation of a body to foster dialogue is proposed: in 2023, a total of 92% of Company employees had union representation or employee representatives. In Europe, TotalEnergies European Works Council met 24 times. The proposed total or partial sale of the service station network in Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxem - bourg to the company Alimentation Couche-Tard was the subject of an information-consultation procedure involving the Committee in parallel with the social procedures in each of the countries concerned.Investors: ongoing demanding and fruitful dialogue We attach particular importance to dialogue with all our shareholders, with whom the members of the Executive Committee, the Lead Independent Director and the Investor Relations team maintain an ongoing dialogue about the Company’s strategy and sustainability policy. The many inter - actions with our individual and institutional shareholders, as well as investor coalitions such as CA100+ or the IIGCC helped provide content for this report and its evolution between 2023 and 2024. The Chairman & CEO and the Lead Independent Director also met twice in 2023 with representatives of the shareholder coalition having submitted a resolution to our Annual General Meeting 2023. Transparency as a principle of action We believe that transparency is essential if we are to build relationships of trust with our stakeholders. We report on our performance through the various commonly used extra- financial disclosure frameworks. For example, we refer to the standards of the GRI (Global Reporting Initiative) since 2003 and the SASB (Sustainability Accounting Standards Board) since 2020. We also include in our reporting the “Core” metrics recommended by the World Economic Forum. 3. Net Zero Emission Study 2050 (epe-asso.org) 4.

On the occasion of its publication, the contributing companies came to share their visions, proposals and commitments for the ecological transition. TotalEnergies is involved in 7 collective initiatives, including one on sobriety. France: exchanges with local players The “Territoires des énergies et au-delà” regional think tanks, convened 37 times in 2023 by the Direction France of TotalEnergies, brought together 500 local stakeholders, members of the business world, civil society (associations, academia, NGOs), public authorities and elected representatives. Their aim was to discuss the challenges of energy transition and economic development. Recommendations and courses of action were published by region5 and shared with our stakeholders. Partnership agreements were concluded in 2023 with the Régions de France association and the Association des Communes et Collectivités d’Outre-mer, as well as a declaration of cooperation with the Grand Est region. We are also continuing our work with the FNSEA6.HIGHLIGHTS|page:89

89 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report 89 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report The nature of our operations involves close inter - action with local communities in our host coun - tries. Our vision of shared prosperity is based on three principles: dialogue and engagement with all our host communities, assessing and reducing the impact of our operations, and contributing to local social and economic development that meets the needs of the community. Contributing to local socio-economic development Long-term operations in a host territory means developing profitable, sustainable projects that create jobs and develop skills locally. TotalEnergies is committed to prior - itizing local jobs and subcontracting locally wherever possible, in accordance with operational constraints. In addition to jobs and using local suppliers for projects, we support education and getting young people into employ - ment, protecting cultural heritage, access to water, health and road safety, which all contribute to reduce inequality. In 2023, more than 1,500 initiatives were supported in these areas. Building ties with host communities Another way of building these ties is by giving our employees the opportunity to get involved in causes close to where they work. The Action! program enables all employees to donate up to 3 workdays a year to local causes. Mentoring a young person or taking care of natural spaces are oppor - tunities to play a part, individually or with others, in achieving Supporting Our Host Communities the Company’s aim of driving positive change locally. In 2023, 10,000 employees took part in more than 14,000 citi - zenship initiatives worldwide as part of this program.

By the end of 2023, the project employed over 1,200 Ugandans and 3,200 Tanzanians, and 92% of the hours worked since the start of the project correspond to jobs for nationals. Since 2022, the project has provided more than 180,000 hours of training to 21,000 people. Also in Uganda and Tanzania, the development of “business centers” has been launched to encourage the participation of local SMEs. Support for SMEs in France Our actions in favor of the local economic fabric are illustrated in France by our help to create and support jobs through interest-free, unsecured loans to French SMEs. In 2023, 130 SMEs benefited from loans worth €5 million, helping to create or support nearly 3,400 jobs.HIGHLIGHTS|page:90

90 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report 90 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report The Mozambique LNG Project has been under Force Majeure since 2021. Nevertheless, activities continued in Cabo Delgado province, with priority given to emergency initiatives including humanitarian support to displaced persons, with shelter, food and access to health services. Societal activities were able to resume as the security situation gradually improved. As the livelihoods of communities have been significantly disrupted by this security crisis, Mozambique LNG engaged in supporting various socio-economic development projects providing sustainable incomes for local families. These include micro-credit for small and medium-sized enterprises. 7,800 jobs have been created to date and more than 2,300 businesses have benefited from financial and technical support, which the Mozambique LNG project continues to monitor. In 2023, the project supported the implementation of 49 socio-economic development initiatives, in the fields of agriculture and food security, infrastructure, and support for entrepreneurship, among others, with a full value chain approach to key sectors (see opposite left).Published in May 2023, Jean-Christophe Rufin’s independent report on the humanitarian situation in Cabo Delgado (see p. 85) highlighted the positive impact of the actions imple - mented on the living conditions of local population. It made a number of recommendations, including the need for a dedicated structure to promote an ambitious and sustainable strategy of local development covering the whole province. The decision was taken by the project to establish the Mozam - bique LNG Foundation, which will support interventions throughout Cabo Delgado province from 2024 onwards. Agricultural development Mozambique LNG supports the development of the agri - cultural sector through the supply of agricultural inputs, technical assistance and market access. 6 projects are underway, benefiting 5,000 beneficiaries, in the production of grains, nuts, seeds, beans and flowers. Over 200 tons of agricultural products were harvested locally in 2023. In addition to contributing to food security, these initiatives serve to restore people’s livelihoods. The purchase of food products for the camps set up under the project has gener - ated over $1.5 million in direct income for local communi - ties. 23 communities in the districts of Palma and Mocimba da Praia have supplied local products, and consumption in the Mozambique LNG camps is 80% local.

91 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report 91 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report Since there is no sustainable development that would leave young people by the wayside, TotalEnergies takes action to give them the means to take charge of their own futures, focusing on the most vulnerable. Helping young people to find work TotalEnergies takes an active approach as an employer: in 2023, we renewed our commitment to welcoming 2,000 work- study students per year into our teams, including 10% work- study students from priority neighborhoods by 2025. At the end of 2023, more than 2,400 work-study students were working within the Company throughout France, including 6.4% from priority neighborhoods. The Company also takes action through its corporate foun - dation, and notably funds L’Industreet, a campus it launched at the end of 2020 in Stains, Seine-Saint-Denis. L’Industreet provides free professional training for young people in indus - trial sectors struggling to recruit. By the end of 2023, 250 18- to-30-year-olds received training and 116 obtained their qualification. The Corporate Foundation also contributed to the opening of a further 10 Production Schools in 2023, bringing the total to 67, as part of a €60 million partnership over 10 years. Making the roads safer, educating about road safety We are committed to road safety for our operations and our customers, to make the roads safer for all users, in particular Making a Commitment to Young People the youngest users, for whom this is the leading cause of death. By sharing our expertise in schools, for example, we are contributing to support reaching SDG 3.6. This is the aim of our VIA Road Safety Education Program. In 2023, the program trained nearly 250,000 school-children in 43 countries, including over 150,000 in Africa and 40,000 in India. The program rollout is supported by employees of the Company’s affiliates.

Supported by its local subsidiaries, it aims to provide 100,000 motorcycle helmets meeting the strictest safety standards to two-wheeler riders in 40 countries in Africa, South America and Asia in 2023 and 2024. It is accompanied by a road safety awareness campaign for motorized two-wheelers. The operation is part of the “Global Safe & Affordable Helmet” campaign spearheaded by Jean Todt, the United Nations Secretary- General’s Special Envoy for Road Safety. By 2023, 37,000 helmets had been distributed in 22 countries. Our Corporate Foundation Created in 1992, the TotalEnergies Corporate Foundation now takes action in four priority areas: inclusion and education; road safety; climate, coastal areas and oceans; cultural dialogue and heritage.

92 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report 92 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report Universal access to clean energy is one of the main aims of the United Nations Sustainable Develop - ment Goals (SDG 7). TotalEnergies’ mission is to deliver energy that is more available, more affordable, more sustainable and accessible to the greatest number of people. The energy transition relies in part on using more electricity, to which we have devoted 30% of our investments in 2023, reaching in particular 22 GW of gross installed renewable electricity generation capacity, including nearly 6 GW in India. We estimate that around a third of our development will be in emerging countries, as described in our SDG7 Energy Compact1 which will enable around 40 million people to benefit from decent or more reliable access to energy for the first time by 2030. Access to clean energy, particularly for cooking, is another essential prerequisite for economic and social development in emerging countries (see p. 93) . In OECD countries, the focus on defending buying power and combating energy insecurity remained strong in 2023. In France, we took measures to help our customers. In February, we unilaterally decided to cap fuel prices at €1.99/l at our 3,400 French service stations. In September, we announced that this cap would be extended beyond 2023, as long as prices remain high. TotalEnergies distributed more than €100 million through the ’Bonus Conso’ operation to encourage energy sobriety in France during the winter of 2022-2023. 50% of our customers reduced their electricity Accessible and Affordable Energy for All consumption by around 15% during this period, i.e. 380 GWh (the consumption of 860,000 inhabitants). Also in France, we have decided to reopen 20 rural stations, to maintain our network and provide local service. Finally, we are developing electric charging stations in France and Europe, with over 19,000 installed in 2023, including almost 1,300 fast or ultra-fast charging stations (> 50 kW) . 1. www.un.org UNIVERSAL ACCESS TO CLEAN ENERGY 7.

Located in the Northern Cape province, the site will supply renewable electricity to the South African national grid for 20 years. In particular, it will supply 75 MW to the national utility Eskom on a continuous basis from 5 am to 9.30 pm, i.e. for longer than the available sunshine. Expected to be operational in 2025, the project is part of a national program to alleviate the country’s electricity supply constraints.HIGHLIGHTS|page:93

93 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report 93 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report Access to clean energy, particularly for cooking, is a prereq - uisite for economic and social development in emerging countries. Today, 2.3 billion people in the world do not have access to it1. By substituting Liquefied Petroleum Gas (a fossil fuel) in the form of bottled gas for wood and charcoal, “clean cooking” has a positive effect on people’s health, the envi - ronment and the economy2. LPG is more efficient for cooking and emits less CO2 than charcoal. It improves air quality, reducing the risk of respiratory complications and cardio - vascular disease. It also reduces some of the negative impacts of traditional biomass use, notably on women (time saved facilitating access to education, employment or entre - preneurship, and financial independence) and on the envi - ronment (deforestation). In 2023, TotalEnergies distributed 910 kt of bottled LPG in Africa and Asia, serving 13 million households and around 50 million people. An enhanced ambition We are stepping up our efforts in Africa and India, and have enhanced our ambition to serve 100 million people by 2030. To achieve this, TotalEnergies plans to invest $400 million in LPG for “clean cooking”, primarily in cylinders but also in storage and filling facilities. In Africa, this new ambition includes opening new LPG activities in Mozambique and Namibia, and continuing the recent development in Rwanda and Tanzania, where LPG activities were launched in 2023. We also intend to signifi - cantly increase our growth in Kenya, Cameroon, South Africa, Ivory Coast and Senegal. In Asia, it concerns India. A woman in Kenya uses bottled LPG to cook, replacing charcoal. 1. www.iea.org: “ Vision for clean cooking access for all ”. 2. www.cleancooking.orgBILLION PEOPLE WORLDWIDE DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO CLEAN ENERGY, NOTABLY FOR COOKING2.3FOCUS CLEAN COOKING BENEFICIARIES OF OUR BOTTLED LPG SALES IN AFRICA AND ASIA 50 MIN 2023|page:94

94 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report 94 Sustainability & Climate 2024 Progress Report Working Alongside Our Suppliers TotalEnergies works with over 100,000 suppliers of goods and services worldwide, for a total spend of around $30 billion in 2023. We can play a major role in encouraging our suppliers to improve their sustainability. Priority 1 • Training our buyers By the end of 2023, 61% of TotalEnergies’ buyers had been trained in sustainable procurement. Additional awareness- raising actions are regularly carried out through thematic webinars. Priority 2 • Raising awareness and mobilizing suppliers The Company regularly raises awareness among its suppliers regarding sustainable development: it engages its main suppliers through a platform, through supplier days such as those organised in March 2023 in China and in July in Nigeria, and also through dedicated training sessions, such as the one organized in May 2023 in Vietnam. Priority 3 • Integration of our sustainability requirements into our purchasing process On the basis of its Fundamental Principles, updated in 2022 to precise climate and sustainability matters, and shared with our suppliers, the Company ensures that societal, envi - ronmental and climate criteria are taken into account during tender evaluation. Priority 4 • Evaluating our suppliers The Company has set itself the target of assessing its 1,300 priority suppliers on all aspects of sustainable development by the end of 2025. In 2023, 37% of priority suppliers have been assessed through documentary and on-site audits. Priority 5 • Support for continuous improvement of suppliers The follow-up of audits and the implementation of action plans have improved working conditions for over 60,000 workers. In particular, corrective measures have ensured that workers’ rights to weekly leave, overtime pay and direct access to drinking water in the workplace are respected. For example, after audits revealed that construction suppliers were not granting their employees a weekly day off, TotalEnergies teams worked with these suppliers to ensure that rest periods were respected. Verification audits in 2023 demonstrated the success of this approach, and rest time is now respected by these suppliers. 230 000 171 60 000SUPPLIERS AUDITED WORKERS OF THEM WORKERS740SINCE 2016 CONCERNING CORRECTIVE ACTION PLANS AUDITED FOR IMPROVEMENT OF WORKING CONDITIONS OFSUPPLIER AUDITS Workers’ Voice survey on EACOP and Tilenga projects In order to test an approach that complements existing audit and grievance mechanisms, TotalEnergies has set up a “workers’ voice survey” pilot in 2023 at two of its major industrial projects in Uganda and Tanzania: Tilenga and EACOP. The aim of this pilot is to directly survey workers from tier 1 suppliers and beyond, via their mobile phones, in order to gather information on their working conditions. HIGHLIGHTS|page:95

Sharing value with governments TotalEnergies pays its share of taxes, making a substantial contribution to the economic development of its host countries. In 2023, the amount of income tax and produc - tion taxes paid by the Company across all operations, came to just over $24.7 billion. The average tax rate was 38.2% in 2023. Payments made by the Company’s extracting entities to governments or territories in which we operate amounted to $28.3 billion in 2023 (mainly taxes, duties and production rights). At the other end of the value chain, product retail, the Company collect excise taxes for government from consumers of energy products. In 2023, it collected $18.2 billion in excise taxes on petroleum products. Sharing with our 100,000 employees worldwide Wages and payroll taxes amounted to $9.2 billion in 2023, including the payment by the Company of an exceptional bonus to all employees, corresponding to 0.75 months’ pay, capped for high salaries. At the Socle Social Commun level in France, representing a total of 14,000 employees, the agreement also provided a 5% pay rise to reflect inflation of 3.6% over the year. In addition, there was a 5% increase in managers’ variable pay.Sharing the Economic Value We Create TotalEnergies also encourages employee shareholding: in 2023, more than 52,600 employees and former employees from 94 countries subscribed to a capital increase in the amount of €353.8 million; more than 10,000 employees also received performance shares. Finally, more than 65% of the Company employees are shareholders in TotalEnergies, and their stake in the Company’s capital stood close to 8% at December 31, 2023, up 50% over the last 10 years. As such, in 2023 they received around €524 million in dividends. An attractive shareholder returns policy TotalEnergies has not reduced its dividend since 1982. The Company’s financial strength enables it to successfully implement its transition strategy and offer shareholders an attractive returns policy. Over the past 10 years, the average annual gross dividend yield has been 5.9%. In 2023, in addition to the 7.1% increase in quarterly interim dividends, a $9 billion share buyback program has been implemented. Payout to shareholders represented therefore 46% of cash flow in 2023. SHARING TOTALENERGIES’S VALUE CREATION IN 2023 16.89.2 97.5 24.767 B$ in 2023|page:96

Lifecycle carbon intensity of energy products sold This indicator measures the average GHG emissions of a unit of energy used by the Company’s customers across its lifecycle (i.e., Scope 1+2+3), from production to end use by customers. This indicator is calculated as a division which takes into account: For the numerator: • emissions related to the production and conversion of energy products used by the customers of the Company; • emissions related to the end use of energy products sold to TotalEnergies customers. For each product, stoichiometric emission factors1 are applied to these sales to obtain a quantity of emissions. Products not intended for combustion, such as bitumen, lubricants and plastics are not taken into account; • less the CO2 sequestered by Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) and natural carbon sinks. For the denominator: • the quantity of energy sold. Electricity is placed on an equal footing with fossil fuels, taking into account average capacity factors and average efficiency ratios. The carbon intensity indicator therefore corresponds to the average emissions associated with each unit of energy used by customers. To track changes in the indicator, it is expressed in base 100 compared to 2015.Lost Time Injury Rate (LTIR) Frequency rate of lost-time injuries. Low-carbon hydrogen Hydrogen produced from non renewable resources but with greenhouse gas emissions below a maximum threshold. For example, the hydrogen produced from natural gas via the steam reforming process associated with a capture and storage (CCS) process. In Europe, the maximum threshold of greenhouse gas emission for low-carbon hydrogen is the same as that for renewable hydrogen, i.e. 3.38 kg CO2e/kg H2 according to the European Directive 2018/2001 named RED II. In common language, low-carbon hydrogen is often considered to include renewable hydrogen. Scope 1 GHG emissions Direct emissions related to the Company’s activities. Direct emissions of biogenic CO2 are excluded from Scope 1 and reported separately. Scope 2 GHG emissions Indirect emissions attributable to brought-in energy (electricity, heat, steam), net of any energy sales, excluding purchased industrial gases (H2). Unless otherwise indicated, TotalEnergies reports Scope 2 GHG emissions using the market-based method defined in the GHG Protocol.where the emission factors published by RTE France have been used). For countries where the end use of LNG sales is not identified, this method is applied to sales weighted by the percentage of electricity generation in local gas consumption. Equity interest domain Sites and industrial assets in which the consolidated affiliates have a financial interest or rights to production. This scope includes the entire statutory scope of the consolidated extra-financial performance statement and the emissions of subsidiaries consolidated by equity method or not consolidated because they are not material from a financial standpoint. Those emissions are calculated on a pro rata basis according to the Company’s share in the entity or the production (in the case of Upstream oil and gas operations).|page:109

and the emissions of subsidiaries consolidated by equity method or not consolidated because they are not material from a financial standpoint. Those emissions are calculated on a pro rata basis according to the Company’s share in the entity or the production (in the case of Upstream oil and gas operations). Greenhouse gases (GHG) The six greenhouse gases named in the Kyoto Protocol: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), with their respective Global Warming Potential (GWP), as described in the 2007 IPCC report. HFCs, PFCs and SF6 are virtually absent from the Company’s emissions or are considered non-material, and are therefore no longer counted as of 2018.Glossary 1. The emission factors used are taken from a technical note of the CDP: Guid- ance methodology for estimation of scope 3 category 11 emissions for oil and gas companies.|page:109

Upstream oil and gas operations Upstream oil and gas exploration and production operations of the Exploration & Production and Integrated LNG segments. Does not include power generation from renewable sources or natural gas, such as combined-cycle gas power plants. Worldwide Human Resources Survey (WHRS) An annual study that includes 292 workforce indicators including the health indicators. The survey covers a representative sample within the consolidated scope. The data published in this document is extracted from the most recent survey, carried out in December 2023 and January 2024; 137 companies in 51 countries, representing 90.0% of the consolidated Company workforce (92,319 employees), responded to all the topics.Scope 3 GHG emissions Other indirect emissions. If not stated otherwise, TotalEnergies reports Scope 3 GHG emissions, category 11, which correspond to indirect GHG emissions related to the end use of energy products sold to the Company’s customers, i.e. from their combustion to obtain energy. The Company follows the oil & gas industry reporting guidelines published by Ipieca, which comply with the GHG Protocol methodologies. In order to avoid double counting, this methodology accounts for the largest volume in the oil, biofuels and gas value chains, i.e. the higher of the two of production volumes or sales. For TotalEnergies, in 2023, the calculation of Scope 3 GHG emissions for the oil and biofuels2 value chains considers products sales with a view to their end use and, for the gas value chain, gas sales either as LNG or as part of direct sales to B2B/B2C customers. A stoichiometric emission (oxidation of molecules to carbon dioxide) factor is applied to these sales or production to obtain an emission volume.
